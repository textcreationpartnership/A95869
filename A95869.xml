            <title>Christ and the Church: or Parallels, in three books. In the first ye have the harmony between Christ and the foregoing types, by which he was fore-shadowed in the Old Testament, both persons and things. In the second the agreement between Christ and other things, to which he is compared in the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament. In the third the agreement between the Church and the types, by which it was foreshadowed in the Old Testament; and other resemblances, by which it is set forth in the holy Scriptures.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:115897:3"/>
            <p>Having obſerved, in ſearch of Divines, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern, many compariſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our dear Saviour and the Types, by which he was fore-ſignified to the Church of the old Teſtament, and the cleering alſo of other reſemblances, by which in the old or new Teſtament he is ſet forth, it came into my mind, to make them Publick: And, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting ſome of my Brethren with my thoughts in this kinde, I was much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by them in this my purpoſe; They judging it of ſingular uſe, both to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt the <hi>Jewes, Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the true <hi>Meſsias</hi> foretold by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and alſo to ſet forth the uſefulneſs of <hi>Christ,</hi> and ſo to ſtirre up men, both earneſtly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, and to be ſeriouſly thankful for him: Beſides the help that it might afford to younger Preachers, which (in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions) would be much: Upon this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement I reſolved to ſet my ſelf to the buſineſs. And this was my firſt intention: yet, Chriſt being the Head and Husband of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> the Body and <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> I thought it fit in the Third Book to acquaint the World with the Compariſons, which in reading I had obſerved between the
<pb facs="tcp:115897:3"/> 
               <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Types</hi> of it, and other reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, by which it is ſet forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which alſo, I hope, that by reading, ye ſhall finde not unuſeful. But there was yet one rub in my way, and that is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> that <hi>all men ſeek their own, and not the things, that are Jeſus Chriſts:</hi> And even thoſe alſo, that ſhould be, as Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, to help forward ſuch Births, even theſe, among the reſt, I finde ſick of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, in which reſpect They will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Publiſhing of any mans Labours, though never ſo uſeful, except They may be ſure to be great gainers by it; whence it is, that the World is deprived of many Monuments of Learning and Piety, which otherwiſe we might have. But this difficulty I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leap over, chuſing rather to Publiſh it (at leaſt for ſo many Copies, as I deſired to have Printed) upon my own account, and at my own charge, rather then to deprive any of any help (how little ſoever it might be) which (at leaſt in the apprehenſion of ſome of my Brethren) this Treatiſe might afford unto them: eſpecially having withal this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, namely, an opportunity to leave a Publick Record, both of your Love to me,
<pb facs="tcp:115897:4"/> and of my Thankfulneſs to you. One thing I ſhall deſire of you, that if in reading, you ſhall finde any fault by which the ſence may be obſcured, you would be pleaſed to look to the end of the Treatiſe, where you ſhall find the faults Corrected. I have no more to ſay, but onely to deſire your favourable acceptance of my weak indeavours, and to believe, that I am, (as indeed I am)</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The brazen Serpent was lifted up upon a Pole, and Chriſt was lifted up upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The brazen Serpent was lifted up for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from Death, and for the healing of them that were ſtung by the fiery Serpents: And Chriſt was lifted up on the Croſs, to ſave them from periſhing, that were ſtung and wounded by Satan the old Serpent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All they were healed, that were ſtung by the fiery Serpents, that did look towards the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, though (either in regard of their diſtance from it, or the weakneſs of their eye-ſight) they could hardly diſcern it, yea, though they were never ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded; whether they were high or low, whether they were rich or poor. So all they have Salvation by Chriſt crucified, that were wounded by the old Serpent, that do with the eye of Faith look unto Chriſt, though they were before never ſo great ſinners, though their Faith be never ſo weak, be they rich or poor.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Onely they of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being ſtung by the fiery Serpents, were healed, who did look towards the brazen Serpent: if any refuſed to look towards it, being wounded, they periſhed.

                     <q>None of them (ſaies he) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Chriſt, roſe to the higheſt pitch of vertue, attained to it without the faith of Chriſt, for the word was afterwards in due time publickly preached, but it was alſo before made known to pure minds. And whereas, as Chriſt entring <hi>Jeruſalem, (Matth.</hi> 21 9.) the people, that went before, and that followed after, cried <hi>Hoſanna, St. Bernard</hi> makes this to be the Moral of it,</q> 
                     <q>That both the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people, going before, and the people of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> following after, do make confeſſion of one and the ſame Chriſtian faith.</q> So final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Zuinglius</hi> aſſerts this for truth. <q>There is the ſame faith, namely, of the Saints that lived before Chriſt, and of us that live ſince Chriſt, and the ſame Teſtament and Covenant to and with both, ſo far as concerns the inward man; for they did no leſſe reſt on the mercy of God
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115897:69"/> through Chriſt promiſed, then we do through Chriſt exhibited.</q> And in this reſpect it is, that the two Teſtaments are compared ordinarily to the two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, which looked each to other, and both to the Mercy-ſeat.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may ſee the Antiquity of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: It is true that the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, which is the ſum of the Goſpel, and of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, hath been frequently charged with novelty, as a new and upſtart Doctrine. But how unjuſtly, may eaſily appear from that which hath been ſaid: for if the rule of godlineſſe hath alway been the ſame from the begining, how can it be agreeable to truth or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thus to impute novelty to it? And (the more to diſcover the falſhood of this charge) hear we what the Scripture ſaies of the tranſcendent Antiquity of it: hear we our Saviour equalizing for Antiquity with all the holy Prophets.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.39</note> 
                     <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>for they teſtifie of me.</hi> Here, by the Scriptures, he means the Books of the old Teſtament, for then there were no other Books of Scriptures: then Chriſtian Religion muſt needs be as ancient, as the Books of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.<note place="margin">Act. 3.24.</note> Conſonant to this is that of <hi>St. Peter. All the Prophets from Samuel, and thoſe that followed after, as many as have ſpoken, have likewiſe foretold of theſe daies.</hi> And that in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10.43</note>

If ye well conſider what hath been ſaid of the compariſon between Chriſt and the Types that went before of him, ye ſhall ſee, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115897:71"/> there is not any Branch of the Doctrine of Chriſt, which was not ſet before them, whether of his Perſon in both Natures, Divine and Humane, or of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Kingly, Prieſtly, and Prophetical; or of his twofold eſtate of Humiliation and Exaltation, or of the benefits that accrue unto us by him. But how are theſe ſet out to them? In dark Types and obſcure Propheſies: The old Church had the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but there was a Cloud of dark Types be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and their eyes: there was a Vail between them and the Holy of Holies, which kept even the ordinary Prieſts themſelves from entering in to behold the things that were therein. In this reſpect the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it <hi>the Mystery that hath been kept ſecret ſince the World began:</hi> and elſewhere,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>But now at laſt God hath made known this Rule of Godlineſs, this Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, to all Nations of the World, the Church being <hi>in populo Catholico</hi> diſperſed among all Nations. And this hath been from the time of Chriſts Aſcenſion to this day, and ſo ſhall be to the end of the World: Therefore our Saviour, being preſently to aſcend into Heaven, enlarged the Commiſſion of his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.19 Mark 16.15</note> even <hi>to teach all Nations,</hi> and <hi>to preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> And therefore, when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doubted, whether he ſhould go to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Gentile,</hi> he was taught in the Viſion, <hi>not to call any thing common or unclean,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.12</note> 
                     <hi>but the ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> And to this Church thus made Catholique, the Rule of Godlineſs, the Doctrine of Chriſt is revealed and ſet out, not by dark Types, as in the Times of the Old Teſtament, but in all plainneſs, ſo that (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) <hi>we do with open face behold the Glory of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18</note> Nor is it ſet down to us in the Future Tenſe, as that which ſhall be in Times to come (as it was in the Old Teſtament) but in the Preſent, or Preterperfect Tenſe, as that which is already done: ſo we hear our bleſſed Saviour crying out on the Croſs,<note place="margin">John 19.30</note> 
                     <hi>Conſummatum eſt, It's finiſhed:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> can tell us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> That <hi>all the Promiſes of God are in him Yea, and in him Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that, by that which hath been ſaid (to ſum up all briefly) we may ſee a manifold variety in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this Rule of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was at the firſt delivered by word of mouth, and handed over by Tradition from Father to Son, and afterwards committed to Writing: God ſaw an admirable expediency in both. It was not written at the firſt, for there was no ſuch danger of corruption, the Church being then in the compaſs of a Family, and the Patriarchs, the Heads of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, being men of ſingular piety. Nay, it was more expedient for the Church, as it then was, to be ſo uſed, as it was; namely, they had frequent appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of the Son of God, they had God oft ſpeaking to them by Angels, and the like; and this was far more convenient for the Church at that ſeaſon, then to have a written Word and no more. Think we, Is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115897:72"/> it not much more perſwaſive, to have God himſelf ſpeaking, then onely to read what is written from him? And who deſires not more to ſee his Friend, and to hear him ſpeak, then to receive a Letter from him? And as for thoſe godly Perſons, to whom the Son of God did not appear, they had yet their Anceſtors, that could tell them, <hi>I have ſeen the Lord;</hi> And, <hi>the Lord hath ſpoken to me.</hi> Yea, it was far more commodious for the Church, which was to enjoy the benefit of the written Word, that the foregoing Church ſhould thus be delt withall by Viſions, Apparitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without a written Word, then to have had a written Word from the begining without theſe: for this was a mean to gain more credit to the Scripture, which was to follow: as it appears by that ſpeech of God to <hi>Moſes; Lo, I come unto thee in a thick Cloud,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 19.9</note> 
                     <hi>that the People may hear when I ſpeak unto thee, and believe thee for ever.</hi> In which words God gives this, as a Reaſon, why the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould hear God ſpeaking to <hi>Moſes,</hi> before <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould write any thing, namely, that they ſhould be moved to believe him for ever. And ſo is the caſe here. So that all that ſpace of time, which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture, was to ſucceeding ages as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, to ſtir up the mindes of men, to receive, read, and hear the Scriptures (to be afterwards delivered to the Church) with more reverence and undoubted Faith.</p>
                  <p>But God would have the Word afterwards commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to writing, becauſe then it was needful; for that the Church was then much enlarged into many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: and therefore there would have been great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in matters of Religion, and much danger of corruption, unleſs God ſhould ſtill have appeared and ſpoken to the Fathers of the ſeveral Families, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were one Prophet in common to teach them
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115897:73"/> all; neither of which were or had been ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. So that (had not this heavenly Doctrine been committed to writing) there would have been (as hath been ſaid) much danger of corruption: yea, we ſee, that before, even when the Church was in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſs, there was corruption. <hi>Adam</hi> had God revealing his Will to him immediately,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. &amp; 6.</note> and yet <hi>Cain</hi> his Son brought in corruption: yea, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sons of God corrupted Religion by their unlawful Marriages. God reſtored the purity of Doctrine to <hi>Noah,</hi> and he teaches it to his Poſterity; and (they being diſperſed over the face of the Earth) it was committed ſpecially to the Poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> and yet (within the ſpace of two hundred years) <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.2 Gen. 20</note> the Father of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſerves other gods. God again reſtores the purity of Doctrine to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and makes him a Prophet: <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſucceeds him, and <hi>Jacob</hi> him, who, dying, commends the keeping of it to his Poſterity; and, it's probable, it was kept pure, as long as the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> lived: but from the death of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's</hi> Sons, until their departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there were not many above an hundred years, and yet the Rule of Godlineſs was ſo worn out in that ſhort ſpace of time,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.7, 8</note> that even thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bred and born in <hi>Egypt</hi> forſooke the Religion of their Fathers, and took up the Cuſtoms of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and became <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Much greater danger there would have been of corruption afterwards, if the Rule of Godlineſs had not then been committed to Writing. And therefore it pleaſed God, in his Wiſdom and Mercy, that now at length the Rule of Godlineſs ſhould be written; both to prevent the Errors, which might otherwiſe have prevailed againſt the Church; and alſo that the Church might have a Rule certain, and certainly known, by which to try all Doctrines and Practices
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115897:73"/> whatſoever: According to that of the Prophet, <hi>To the Law, and to the Testimony:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 8.20</note> 
                     <hi>If they ſpeak not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Stand we ſtill and wonder at the Goodneſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our gracious God, ſo providing for his Church, and anſwering her neceſſities; ſo managing his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as may be moſt ſuitable to the condition of the Church: particularly in this, That he contents himſelf to deliver this Rule of Godlineſs by word of mouth, when there was leſs danger of corruption; but then committing it to Writing, when there was more danger in this kinde: Fail we not,<note place="margin">Pſalm 96.8</note> 
                     <hi>to give unto God the Glory due to his Name,</hi> even the Glory of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Wiſdom and unſpeakable Mercy. But be we alſo careful to anſwer Gods expectation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And, having this written Word, as a ſure Rule by which to try all Doctrines,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.14</note> Let us <hi>not be as Children toſſed up and down with every wind of Doctrine: let us not believe every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits,</hi>

                  <p>But Saint <hi>Chryſostom</hi> gives another Reaſon of this various Adminiſtration of the Rule of Godlineſs. <q>In the begining God ſpake to men by himſelf; ſo he ſpake to <hi>Adam,</hi>

                     <hi>was kept ſecret ſince the world began, but is now made manifeſt.</hi> So that the light, which was then, was but darkneſſe in compariſon of the light that ſhines now: the Sun then under a cloud, which is now vaniſhed: Oh the ſingular goodneſſe of God to us that live now, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them that lived under the old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>But what a ſhame is it, that we who live now, and enjoy ſo cleer a revelation of Chriſt, ſhould ſuffer our ſelves to be outſtript by them, that were in the dark in compariſon of our ſelves? who knowes not, that a Maſter may juſtly, and will certainly expect more and better work at the hands of a ſervant to whom he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords

And now, ſee we, is not this our caſe? Such is the odds between us, that live now, above them that lived under the old Teſtament: God affords us a cleerer light then to them: And yet we are ſo far from outſtripping them, that for the moſt part, we ſuffer our ſelves to be out-ſtripped by them.

And thereupon they were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115897:77"/> reſtrained from bringing.</hi> But on the other ſide, how baſely niggardly are men in theſe dayes? ſo farre from abounding in free-will-offerings for the ſervice of God, that, what they are tyed to pay by the command of God, or man, or what they have by their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe bound themſelves to contribute for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the miniſtry among them, they are hardly drawn to give; nay many altogether refuſe, nay, many pull away that which was voluntarily given by their Anceſtors. See the devotion of the old Church. Their ſervice was coſtly and troubleſome, and yet the godly <hi>Jews</hi> were moſt diligent and devout in it. But how great is our want of devotion? Gods ſervice among us is eaſie and cheap, and yet men take no delight, nor exerciſe any devotion in it. What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes are made in mens coming to the Church? a groſs abuſe: how irreverent are men in prayer? while they vouchſafe not to bow the knee, but ſit on their ſeats: being worſe then the Camels,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.11</note> which <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant taught to kneel, while he was at prayer. Finally, ſee the devotion of thoſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> They were without,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.9, 10</note> while <hi>Zachary</hi> was burning incenſe in the Temple, and were not permitted to enter,<note place="margin">Verſ. 11.12</note> and <hi>Zachary</hi> was detained lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then ordinary by reaſon of the viſion, which he ſaw: and though they wondred at his long ſtay,<note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> yet they waited for him, as not willing to depart without his bleſſing. But now, though men are admitted into the places of Gods worſhip, and are coagents with the miniſters of God in the publick ſervices, yet are they hardly perſwaded to attend, but turn their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God before the Sermon is ended, if the Miniſter ſhall never ſo little exceed the limits of any hour. Let us be aſhamed of this, we enjoying ſo clear a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt above the godly <hi>Jewes,</hi> to be outſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by them, whoſe light in compariſon of the light
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115897:78"/> ſhining upon us, was but as darkneſſe, and let us for the time to come double our diligence, and labour at leaſt to come up to the moſt eminent among them. We can readily ſay, that that Son is bound to do beſt, for whom, in his education, his father hath done moſt.</p>

                     <q>The Lord did not doubt to ſay, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> when he gave the ſign of his Body.</q> And this was in regard of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent harmony between the Body of Chriſt and Bread, between the Blood of Chriſt and Wine, which ye may ſee in ſundry Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In ſome common Things: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Bread and Wine are neceſſary things; there is no living without them: we are taught to pray for Bread, as the ſtaff of our lives: All Bread and no Drink, or all Drink and no Bread, were either of them unkindly. Hear we what the Pſalmiſt ſays; <hi>Wine to cheer the heart of man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 104.15</note> 
                     <hi>and Bread to ſtrengthen mans heart.</hi> All the Wealth of the World would do a man ſmall pleaſure, if he were debarred of the uſe of either or both of theſe. So the Body and Blood of Chriſt are of abſolute neceſſity to a Chriſtian: there is no poſſibility of living eternally without theſe. It is moſt true, that our Saviour ſays; <hi>If any man eats of this Bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 6.51</note> 
                     <hi>he ſhall live for ever:</hi> and it's no leſs

                     <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>and drink his blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is (as an abſolute, ſo) a continual neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of theſe creatures of Bread and Wine; Bread to be eaten, and ſomething to be drunk: And in this reſpect our Saviour teaches us to make it our dayly ſuit, <hi>Give us this day our dayly Bread:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6</note> ſo there is a dayly and continual neceſſity of Chriſt, that we ſhould feed upon his Body, and drink his Blood, and apply unto our ſelves the Merits of his Death: For both it's true, <hi>There is no man that lives, and ſins not;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chro. 6.36 Iam. 3 2</note> and ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. Bread is ſo convenient and excellent food, that under it our bleſſed Saviour comprehends all things neceſſary for the body: As indeed,<note place="margin">Matth. 6</note> if a man have good Bread and good Drink, he may make a good ſhift to live, though he hath nothing elſe: So, if by a true and living Faith we lay hold upon Chriſt, eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, we ſhall want nothing that is needful unto Salvation. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>ſhall drink of the Water that I ſhall give him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 4.14</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall never thirſt.</hi> And, <hi>I am the Bread of Life:</hi>

                     <hi>He that comes unto me, ſhall never hunger; and he that believes in me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> And no marvel; for,<note place="margin">Col. 3.11</note> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays, <hi>Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is nothing which, in the compoſition of it, doth more reſemble the Body and Blood of Chriſt,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115897:87"/> then do theſe creatures of Bread and Wine. Conſider it a little: The Corn, which is the matter of Bread, is cut down with the Sickle, hurried in the Cart, threſhed with the Flail, fanned and winnowed in the Wind, ground to powder in the Mill, kneaded with the Hand and ſtrength of the Arms, and finally muſt endure the heat of the Oven; and all this, before it be Bread.

Wine cheeres and comforts a man, that is ready to droop through faintneſſe and weakneſſe: ſo the blood of Chriſt hath a cheering and a refreſhing power: how ſhall it not cheer and refreſh the ſoul, weary and heavy laden with the ſenſe of ſin, to know, that Chriſt hath ſhed his precious blood, whereby he hath made infinite ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God for the ſins of the world? So its a comfort and cheering to a man, that is deeply indebted, for which he is in danger of priſon, to know that his friend and ſurety hath paid the debt, and ſatisfied the Creditor.

                  <p n="3">3. Wine takes coldneſſe from the body, and heates and warmes it, ſo the blood of Chriſt drunk by faith, is a notable mean to take away the coldneſſe of love to God and to our brethren, and to make our love to both more fervent: for, when we conſider the great and ardent love of God to us, giving his Son to dye and ſhed his blood for us, and of Chriſt actually and voluntarily dying and ſhedding his blood for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, how can it do other, then increaſe the heat

                     <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.</hi> And now, if we have any ſparke of ingenuity, how can it be, but that we ſhall thus argue? If God, if Chriſt, hath ſhewed ſuch fervent love to me, as to think nothing, no, not his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, too good to give to us and for us, what can I do leſſe, then return fervent love to God and to Chriſt? what ſhall I think too good for God, and for Chriſt? what ſhall I think too much or too hard to do or to ſuffer for them? for, as the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us first;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.19.</note> ſo the ſerious thought of the fervency of the love of Chriſt, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his blood for us, cannot but ſtirre us up to ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of love unto God, and to Chriſt.

Of this uſe is the blood of Chriſt in ſpiritual reſpects: namely, being received by faith, it hath a power to make us ſecure and confident in reſpect of God, and bold in confeſſion before men. Nor is there cauſe to wonder, that it is thus uſeful: how ſhall it not be a juſt ground of holy ſecurity towards God, to know, that (though by our ſins we have incurred Gods juſt diſpleaſure, and for them, might juſtly expect the dreadful effects of it, yet) Chriſt hath by his blood made an attonement for us, having thereby fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his infinit Juſtice infinitely offended by our ſins? and how ſhall not the ſenſe of Chriſts love to us in ſhedding his blood for us, make us bold to confeſſe his name before men, chooſing rather to expoſe our ſelves to any hardſhip, to the extreameſt torments, that the malice of men or divels can inflict upon us, then through cowardice and faintheartedneſſe to betray the cauſe of Chriſt? This, this it was, that led thoſe triumphant Martyrs, under the Heathen or <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperors, and under That man of Sin, through all their torments with ſo much courage and reſolution, that,<note place="margin">Stetere torti torquentibus fortiores. <hi>Cypr. epiſt.</hi>

It is not, that God hath been wanting to us in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: for he hath given us his own Son to ſhed his blood for us, thereby to obtain for us remiſſion of ſins and reconciliation with God, wherein he hath given us a lively evidence of his unſpeakable love to us: and this as I have ſhewed before, is of ſufficient force to fence us againſt all theſe defects; The fault is therefore in our ſelves, becauſe having the remedy in our hands we make not uſe of it, we do not by faith drink of this wine, the blood of Chriſt, we do not ſtirre up the act of our faith, to believe, that Chriſt ſhed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood for us, we do not ſeriouſly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon all occaſions meditate of his love to us mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted herein.

Finally, do we finde our ſelves fearful and timerous, affraid to ſuffer afflictions for the cauſe of Chriſt, and in that reſpect, affraid to confeſſe Chriſt before men, when danger attends it? let us have recourſe to this remedy: look we at our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffering all kinds of indignities, and at laſt lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life, and ſhedding his precious blood for us: think we, What are we in compariſon of Chriſt? if the Lord hath done this for his ſervants, yea for his enemies, why ſhould we think much to ſuffer any thing for him?</p>

                  <p>Now from this Parallel between Chriſt and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we may learn two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The excellent condition of all godly Chriſtians, that are Chriſtians in good earneſt, and not onely in name and ſhew. I juſtly add this laſt clauſe; for,<note place="margin">Praeter nomen nihil.</note> many are Chriſtians in name, that have <hi>nothing beſides the name:</hi> and againſt ſuch <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> hath a ſad Paſſage: <q>If any (ſays he) are found not to live ſo as Chriſt hath taught,<note place="margin">

                           </gap>. Defenſ. pro Chriſtian. ad Antonin. Pium.</note> it's a certain argument, that they are not Chriſtians, though with the Tongue they profeſs the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt: for Chriſt ſays, That not all that profeſs his Name ſhall be ſaved, but they that by their Works make good their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</q> But, whoſoever are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed and ſhew it by a Chriſtian Converſation, let them know, that their condition is excellent: for here is both Honor and Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is Honor, for they are the Children of God: and who knows not this to be an unſpeakable Honor and Preferment? <hi>David</hi> could ſay,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18</note> 
                     <hi>Seems it to you a ſmall matter, that I ſhould be Son-in-law to a King?</hi> And is it not a much greater preferment, That we, who were by Nature Children to the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Children of Wrath, ſhould be made the Children of God, who is the ſole ſupreme King of the whole Univerſe, and ſo Brethren to Chriſt, who is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with him, whom God hath made Heir of all things? Is it not an Honor, That the Angels, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attendants of the Throne of God, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Miniſters to us? our Tutors and Guardians? as it was an Honor done to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> That <hi>Haman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſth. 6.10</note> the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115897:97"/> chief favorite of that great King <hi>Ahaſhu roſh,</hi> ſhould be ordered to array him, and to carry him on horſe-back through the ſtreets of the City? Is it not an high honour if a great King ſhall admit an ordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſit with him on the throne? what an honour is it then, to ſit with Chriſt on his Throne? But, as we have heard, This Honor have all the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And what Comfort can be wanting here? If God be our Father, how can we want any thing that is good for us? How can we want Protection againſt all Enemies? How ſhall any wrong be done to us, which ſhall not be avenged to the full? And why ſhould we be afraid of Death? Our bodies ſhall in death be turned to aſhes, but they ſhall be raiſed again, and be clothed with incorruption? How ſhall it be grievous to us, that we cannot come to Glory, but through many Afflictions? It's no otherwiſe with us in this reſpect, then it was with the Prince of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who was in like manner made perfect through ſuffering: and though the Way be unpleaſing, yet the End is highly deſirable; as Chriſt did, ſo we ſhall be ſure, after we have ſuffered, to come to Reſt and Glory.</p>
                  <p>But here is alſo Duty expected at our hands, even to be careful to walk honorably, according to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that God hath put upon us. Sordid carriage ill becomes honorable perſons. The contrary is expected at our hands. Hear Saint <hi>Paul: I beſeech you to walk worthy of the Calling wherewith ye are called.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.1</note> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: <hi>Ye were once Darkneſs, now are ye Light in the Lord,</hi>

                     <hi>walk as Children of Light.</hi> God ſo juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting this at our hands, let us not fruſtrate his expectation.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. See we here the ſuperexcellency of our bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour, even according to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:

He is the Foundation of Salvation, in that He is the onely meritorious cauſe of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Salvation of the Church is grounded upon Chriſt; namely, upon the Merit and Efficacy of his Death and Paſſion: And in this reſpect not any man, but God himſelf alone hath laid this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo ſayes the Prophet, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God,</hi>

He is the Foundation of Faith or Doctrine; and this is to be underſtood by a Metonymie of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the adjunct, Chriſt being put for the Doctrine of Chriſt, that is, the fundamental Doctrine of Chriſt, which conſiſts not of thoſe Theological Concluſions, needful to Divines for their peculiar Profeſſion,<note place="margin">Irenic. p. <hi>149</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

And in this ſenſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is ſometimes by the Faithers ſaid to be a Foundation: and we deny it not; but it was no more then belonged to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays plainly:<note place="margin">Hoc utique erant &amp; caeteri Apoſtoli, quod fuit Petrus. <hi>De Unit.

In that Chriſt is the onely Foundation of the Church, hence we learn, That the Fathers before Chriſt were alſo built upon the ſame Foundation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with us;<note place="margin">Acts 15.11</note> in that <hi>they were ſaved by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Christ, even as we.</hi> Chriſt was then preached unto them, and believed on by them.

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> I. c. 23</note> as we have heard before. The Enemies then of Chriſtian Religion have no cauſe to object Novelty to it: nor ſhall the <hi>Jews</hi> need to be ſhy of receiving Chriſtian Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Salvation by Chriſt crucified, for fear of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Religion of their Forefathers: for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was the ſame with ours now; As Saint <hi>Austin</hi> plainly affirms it:<note place="margin">Res ipſa, quae nunc dicitur Chriſtiana Religio, erat &amp; apud antiquos, nec defuit ab initio generis humani, quouſque Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus veniret in carne, unde vera Religio, quae jam erat, coepit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellari Chriſtiana. <hi>Retract. l. 1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>The thing it ſelf (ſays he) which is now called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115897:104"/> Religion, was among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; nor was it wanting from the begining of Mankinde till Chriſt came in the fleſh; whence the true Religion which then was, began to be called Chriſtian.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence we may ſee (in all the variety of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in the World) who do, and who do not hold the Foundation. And (to ſay nothing of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Pelagians, and others) look we eſpecially at the Controverſie between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether of us hold the Foundation: they ſay, they do; we ſay, we do. But it will be fully cleared by the point in hand. The Doctrine of Chriſt is the onely Foundation; whetherſoever therefore of us hold this Doctrine ſincere and incorrupt, they may truly be ſaid to hold the Foundation. Now, as for the Papiſts, it is ſure, That they hold it not: for, howſoever, in word, they profeſs the Creed and the Decalogue, yet, in deed, they overthrow both. In Particulars it were eaſie to be infinite. They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Worſhip of Images againſt the direct letter of the Decalogue; they make ſome ſins venial in their own nature, without reſpect to the Mercy of God, and the Merits of Chriſt: They brag of their own Merits, Perfection and Satisfactions: They deny Chriſts ſole Oblation, while they offer him up dayly in the Maſs: They worſhip the Pope as God, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt for Chriſt: They ſubject the Word of God to the Power of the Pope. In a word, They ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the Worſhip of God, and the Religion of Chriſt, that, if the Apoſtles ſhould return again to the Earth, they would finde little among them, but meer illuſions; and, for Chriſtianity, Paganiſm, covered over with the name of Chriſtianity. And all this may
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115897:105"/> with much eaſe be made plain, by comparing the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> with the ſeveral Branches of the Fundamental Doctrine of Chriſt, recorded by the Prophets and Apoſtles in their ſeveral Writings. But I forbear. As for us Proteſtants, it's alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, That, through the Mercy of God, we have kept, and do keep the Foundation, the pure Voyce of the Law, and the incorrupt Doctrine of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, Grace, and Faith, and the Worſhip of God according to the Scriptures. It's true, that there is among us a grievous Rent: ſome are called <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,</hi> ſome <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and (even on both ſides) ſome (giving way to immoderate heat, not becoming Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) have not ſpared to caſt Criminations and Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions each on other, as if, on the one or other ſide, the Foundation had been left and forſaken, and as if the Queſtions agitated between us were Fundamental. But the truth is (as ſome more moderate Divines, and among the reſt <hi>Paraeus,</hi> have made it plain) That, howſoever we differ one from another in ſome of thoſe Articles which he calls Theological Concluſions, the ſound and entire knowledg of which is neceſſary for Divines; yet, in the Catholique Articles, there is full Agreement between the Divines on both ſides, and that herein we all hold together againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors. Take we the very words of <hi>Paraeus:</hi> for, having diſtinguiſh'd the Articles of Religion into Catholique and Theological (as alſo did Dr. <hi>

                     </note> he was ſown in the garden, for in a garden he was taken, and buried; and in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he grew, where alſo he roſe again; and he became a tree, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the Sons.</hi> Deſire you to know Chriſt a grain, and ſown? Hear what our Saviour ſaies: <hi>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, it remains alone, but if it dye, it brings forth much fruit, (Joh.</hi> 12.24.) But he is both a grain of wheat, becauſe he ſtrengthens mans heart, and a grain of Muſtardſeed, becauſe he heates the heart of man. But if Chriſt be a grain of Muſtardſeed, how is he the leaſt, and doth grow? (for ſo St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> in laying down the ſame parable, ſpeaks of the Muſtard-ſeed, <hi>which,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but when its grown, its the greateſt among herbs, and becomes a tree, Matth.</hi> 13.32.) Would you know him to be the leaſt? hear
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115897:108"/> the Prophet, <hi>He hath no form nor comelineſſe, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him, (Iſa.</hi> 53.2.) Would you know him the greateſt? hear the Pſalmiſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art fairer then the children of men,</hi> for he that had no form nor comelineſſe, is made more excellent then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, tranſcending the glory of the Prophets. He is therefore the leaſt of all the ſeeds, becauſe he came not in a Kingdome, nor in riches: but ſuddenly, as a tree, he ſent out his branches that we might ſay, as the Spouſe,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.3</note>

               </p>
               <p>But the word [Chriſt] hath another acception, namely, not alone, for Jeſus our Redeemer, but alſo for Chriſt myſtical, conſiſting of Chriſt the Head, and the whole number of Chriſtians as the Body, and particular Chriſtians, as members in particular: And ſo the word is uſed by the Apoſtle; where he ſaies, <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members,</hi>

It's a part of Humanity, being to travel with them that are weak and ſlow-paced, not therefore to forſake them, becauſe they cannot keep pace with us, but to ſtay for them, and ſo to take them along with us. So let us exerciſe meekneſs and patience towards them whom we perceive to be infirm and weak; they cannot go ſo faſt as we, ſtay for them with patience: They fall ever and anon, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor <hi>to restore them with the ſpirit of meekneſs.</hi>

               <p>IN this Compariſon Chriſt is to be conſidered, not as God alone, nor as Man alone, but as God and Man in one Perſon: for this is a Branch of the Glory of Chriſt, expreſt in the phraſe of his <hi>ſitting at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand:</hi> but that agrees to Chriſt in regard of both his Natures.

                  <hi>the Church,</hi> as he had

                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.15</note> but this latter agrees to Chriſt in reſpect of both: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas there are many properties of an Head, they are not all to be found in Chriſt, as he is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor as he is Man alone; but ſome of them agree to him as he is Man, others of them as he is God: As for example, That he be the Head of the Church, it's neceſſary, that he have conformity of Nature with the Church, as the Head of the natural Body hath with the Body: but this is not to be found in Chriſt as he is God; for ſo there is an infinite diſproportion between Chriſt and the Church, as between Spirit and Fleſh, between Heaven and Earth: but, if we look at Chriſt as Man, ſo we ſhall finde this conformity of Nature: for,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.14</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the Children</hi> (ſays Saint <hi>Paul) were partakers of fleſh and blood, He alſo took part of the ſame.</hi> On the other ſide, to the end that Chriſt be the Head of the Church, it's neceſſary, that he be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſpiritual and heavenly Life to the Church and all the Members of it, as the Head is the Fountain of natural Life to all the Members of the natural Body: but Chriſt, as Man alone, could not be ſo; Chriſt-Man is ſo, but not as Man. It's manifeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That it agrees to Chriſt, as God and Man, to be the Head of the Church. Nor will it be of any force to the contrary, if any ſhall object, That this or that property of an Head, namely, conformity of Nature with the Members, agrees not to Chriſt as God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, as God, cannot be the Head of the Church; or, This or that property of an Head, namely, to give an influence of ſpiritual Life to all his Members, cannot agree to Chriſt as Man, therefore Chriſt, as Man, cannot be the Head of the Church: for, to this end, That Chriſt ſhould be the Head of the Church in both Natures, it's not neceſſary, that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115897:114"/> of an Head ſhould diſcover themſelves in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature ſeverally; it ſuffices, that they are all to be found in the whole Perſon, ſome in reſpect of one Nature, ſome in reſpect of the other.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt is frequently called the Head of the Church:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.22</note> 
                  <hi>And hath given him</hi> (namely, Chriſt) <hi>to be the Head over all things to the Church.</hi> And again: <hi>Grow up into him in all things,</hi>

               <p>And the Reſemblance holds excellently between Chriſt, and the Head of the natural Body, and that in ſundry Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Head hath conformity of Nature with the Body, and the Members of it; elſe it's a Monſter. It were a ſtrange ſight, to ſee an Head and a Body, like the Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in his Dream:<note place="margin">Dan. 2.32, 33</note>

                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 2.14</note>

When in the death of our bleſſed Saviour, there was a ſeparation made between his ſoul and his body (the ſoul going to paradiſe, and the body to the grave,) yet ſtill the union remained firm between the Divine Nature, and the Humane, the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remaining in firm union with the ſoul in Heaven,<note place="margin">Lib. de fide</note> and with the body in the grave, as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So is it here: when in death there ſhall be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of our natures, yet the union remaines firm between Chriſt and a true believer: the ſoul is not by death ſevered from Chriſt: nay, whereas in the time of this life, the ſoul enjoyes Chriſt onely by faith, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death it ſhall enjoy him fully,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12</note> immediatly and by ſight. <hi>Now I ſee darkly,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>as through a glaſſe, but then face to face.</hi> And this enjoying of Chriſt the Apoſtle makes to be a conſequent of his diſſolution.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23</note>

                  <hi>the filth of the world, and the off-ſcouring of all things.</hi> Wonderful odds between Chriſt and us! and yet that we ſhould be brought into ſo near an union and communion with him, he to be our head, and we his members, who can ſufficiently wonder at ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.</note> well may we ſay, as <hi>David, Seemes it to you a ſmall thing, &amp;c?</hi> If a King, riding in his triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, in all ſtate through the ſtreets of his City, ſhould caſt his eyes upon ſome malefactor, juſtly for ſome hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence condemned to death, and now upon the hurdle drawing towards the place of execution; if he ſhould now ſtand ſtill, cauſe him to riſe from his hurdle, pardon his offence, give him his life, appoint him to be clad in Royal apparel, take him into his Chariot, and ſo make him ſharer with him in his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory; would any ſleight it, as an ordinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage? would it not raviſh any man? would not any man confeſſe it to be rare and ſingular preferment? But all this is nothing to this in hand: we were in as ill caſe, and as baſe by nature, as any malefactor, living in a daily expectation of everlaſting death: and all the Kings of the earth are nothing to Chriſt, nor is their glory any thing in compariſon of his, they are finite creatures, he is the infinite Creator; their glory is imaginary, tranſitory, finite; his is ſubſtantial, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, infinite. And he is God, equal with his Father, and therefore though our union and fellowſhip be at the firſt hand with his Humanity, yet its alſo at the ſecond hand with his God-head, and conſequently with the Father and Holy Ghoſt: Oh rare honour! Oh excellent condition of believers! the luſtre of it would certainly dazle the eyes of worldlings, if it were external: but its inward and ſpiritual, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered oft with a vail of weakneſſes and external baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore the world knowes it not, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115897:117"/> therefore it deſpiſes and tramples us under foot. But howſoever, its yet true that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies,<note place="margin">Prov. 12.16</note> 
                  <hi>the righteous man is more excellent then his neighbour.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> with his iron chains, in a better condition then <hi>Agrippa</hi> in all his Pompe; poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying at the rich mans gate craving the ſcraps for his relief, then the rich glutton himſelf faring deliciouſly every day, and clad in purple: The pooreſt Chriſtian ſlave ſerving in the Galleys, then the Grand Seigneur himſelf, attended with his train of <hi>Janizaries.</hi> Let us then impute the contempt, which men caſt upon us, to their ignorance of us: and therefore let us ſlight it, and pleaſe our ſelves (as well as we may) with that, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us of the honour done unto us in our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, while he is given to us, to be our head, and we to be his body and members in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See how great the error of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, making the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> the head of the Church, over all Churches, and all Biſhops of all Churches throughout the whole world, yea even over all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Commonwealths, and over all the Kings of the Earth in their ſeveral Kingdomes. That all this is true of Chriſt, no true Chriſtian can deny, and we ſhew warrant for it: <hi>All power,</hi> ſaies our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.18 Rev. 11.15</note> 
                  <hi>is given to me both in Heaven and in Earth.

                  <hi>farre above all principalities, &amp;c, and hath put all things under, &amp;c. and given him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi> will be a Supreme viſible Head over all Churches, as Chriſt is Inviſible, let him ſhew his warrant, and ſo let them, that contend ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this his pretended Monarchy. But this they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115897:118"/> can never be able to do. They indeed acknowledge Chriſt alone to be the Supreme Head, but yet with them the Pope is a ſecundary Head, as Chriſts Vicar-general, in whom muſt reſt all the power to reſolve all doubts, to determine all Controverſies, to frame new Articles of Faith, &amp;c. But where is their warrant? Its eaſie to obſerve,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28 Eph. 4.11.</note> that among all the Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Church mentioned in Scripture, there is not any the leaſt intimation made of a Vicar-general of Chriſt over all the members of the whole Church in the world: and that its not an abſolute Government, but a meer Miniſtery, that is to be exerciſed by them. Nay, in all the times of the Apoſtles themſelves there was not the leaſt ſhew of a Monarchy in the Church, but rather the contrary: for whatſoever controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were to be decided, or whatſoever affaires of the Church were to be ordered, we ſee all done by the joynt conſent of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Act. 1. &amp; 6. &amp; 15.</note> and the conſent of the People. Beſides, ſuch a Monarchy of the Pope of Rome, or any other Biſhop over all Churches and Biſhops is to no purpoſe, nor of any uſe: for what need is there of a ſubſtitute, where the chief is preſent? but Chriſt hath promiſed that he,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20</note> though aſcended, will be with his Church to <hi>the end of the world.</hi> Yea, ſuch an abſolute Monarchy in the Church is very dangerous, and may prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hurtful, being in danger through mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to degenerate into a Tyranny, as we ſee by woful experience. But, ſay they, Monarchy is the beſt form of Government in the Commonwealth, therefore it is ſo in the Church. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great difference between the ſtate of the Church and of the Commonwealth. In which reſpect, though a Monarchy be beſt for the Commonwealth, yet its not ſo for the Church, if we reſpect the viſible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115897:118"/> but if we reſpect Chriſt, the Government is Monarchical. But there is, ſay they, ſuch a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy among the Angels in heaven, <hi>Lucifer</hi> once, and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> now, being the Supreme over all the reſt, and all the reſt ſubject to them: therefore it ſhould be ſo in the Church Militant. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To ſay nothing of the conſequence, which is alſo unſound, the antecedent is all falſe, being compact of dotages.<note place="margin">Iſa. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Lucifer</hi> is <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar; Michael</hi> is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Angels do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any ſuperior but Chriſt. But they ſay, Chriſt gave the Monarchy to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> above all the Apoſtles, and conſequently to his Succeſſors above and over all the ſucceſſors of the other all Apoſtles: And St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſſively are his ſucceſſors. <hi>Anſw.</hi> All theſe things are either falſe, or at leaſt uncertain. That Chriſt gave to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Monarchy over the whole Church, is falſe, and cannot be proved by Scripture, but the contrary is manifeſt: where was St. <hi>Peters</hi> Monarchy, when at that <hi>Hieroſolymitane</hi> Councel, not Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> but St. <hi>James</hi> gave the difinitive ſentence? when he was fain to give account to the Church of his affaires tranſacted with <hi>Cornelius?</hi> and finally, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 11.</note> withſtood him to his face? Queſtion is made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were ever at <hi>Rome:</hi> falſe it is, that he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> and that the following Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were and are his Succeſſors in that Office, which he did execute. The more full proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe particulars would take up too much time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See what comfort iſſues hence to all godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in that Chriſt is an Head to and over us. He is Man, as we are, in all things like unto us, ſin one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted; then he will be ſure to love us, to tender us, to compaſſionate us; for to this end he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115897:119"/> became man, and he took our nature into unity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with himſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.17</note> 
                  <hi>that he might be a merciful high Priest;</hi> and ſo the Scripture ſpeaking of his ſympathizing with us,<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> ſaies, <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted.</hi> yea, he, that is our Head, is God alſo, as well as man, therefore he is and will be with us, whereſoever we are; for, as God, he is Infinite, without limits of Eſſence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Immenſe, without limits of quantity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Omnipreſent, without limits of place. According to his promiſe then,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I will be with you unto the end of the world;</hi> he is ſtill preſent with us, as God, though his Manhood be taken away from us, according to that, which he himſelf ſaies, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.20.</note> 
                  <hi>there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> namely, to help us by his Spirit, and to hear us: what hopes then may we have of the acceptance of our prayers, and the granting of our requeſts? If we be in the Fire, in the Dungeon, in the Deſert, in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he is with us, to uphold us, to comfort us, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through all, to deliver us out of all. Yea, He that is our Head, is God, therefore infinitely able to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to folly all the Policies and Counſels of all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Achitophels</hi> or <hi>Machiavels</hi> in the world, and to take them in their own craftineſſe. Yea, therefore he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in ſtrength, able to do what he will for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Church and the members of it, and for the deſtruction and overthrow of all his Churches enemies: what comfort then can they want, that have ſuch an head? what calamity can come in the way ſo great, againſt which this relation between Chriſt and us, as between head and members, may not abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort us?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let enemies of the Church be hereby admoniſhed, not to go on any longer to moleſt and afflict god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſcientious Chriſtians, to plot and act
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115897:119"/> miſchief againſt them: They are Members of Chriſt, and Chriſt is their Head; and what ye do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ye do againſt Chriſt. So when <hi>Saul</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi>) went on, as a Wolf of the Evening, to trouble the Chriſtians, our Saviour (though in his own Perſon out of the reach of his malice) cryed out, <hi>Why doſt thou perſecute me?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 9.4</note> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> obſerves well upon that place, <q>That our Saviour ſaid not,<note place="margin">Non dixit, Sanctos meos, aut Servos meos, ſed, Quid me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequeris? i. e. membra mea: caput pro membris clamabat. Vocem pedis ſuſcipit lingua, quando forte in turba pes contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dolet, clamat lingua, Quid calcas me? non dicit, Pedem meum; ſed ſe calcari dicit, quam nemo tetigit; pes autem, qui calcatur, non ſeparatur à lingua. <hi>In Pſal. 31.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>My Saints,</hi> or, <hi>My Servants;</hi> but, <hi>Why doſt thou perſecute Me?</hi> that is, my Members: the Head cryed out for his Members: So the Tongue takes up the complaint of the Foot; If the Foot, being by chance trod upon in a Croud, be put to pain, the Tongue complains, Why do you tread upon me? It ſays not, My Foot, but Me, which no man touched; but the Foot, that is trod upon, is not ſevered from the Tongue.</q> And ſo your hoſtility is not terminated upon a meer man, who, haply, is meek under the effects of your cruelty, and out of charity prays for you, That your ſin may not be layd to your charge; but it lights upon a jealous and angry God, the Head of the Church, who takes it deeply to heart, That his faithful Servants, the Members of his Myſtical Body, ſhould be ſo infeſted and wronged:<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.6</note> and with whom <hi>it's a righteous thing to recompence Tribulation to them that trouble them.</hi> And he is able to do it; for he is, as Man, ſo God, and therefore infinitely able to confound the ſtouteſt of Enemies. And ſee in experience of all Times, if it hath not been ſo. See, if the proud and fierce Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church, while they have plotted and acted
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115897:120"/> Cruelties againſt the Church, have not done it to their own confuſion, as not being able to ſtand againſt Chriſt, the Head of the Church. Look upon <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, Maximinianus, Maxentius, Licinius, Julian, &amp;c.</hi> whom the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories ſet forth, as cruel Enemies againſt the Church: and in them all, we ſhall finde it to be true,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.21</note> that the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>They that hate the righteous, ſhall be deſolate.</hi> And again: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded be all they that hate Sion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">129 4, 5</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall be as the graſs on the houſe-top, which withers before it grows up, &amp;c.</hi> Be adviſed therefore, as ye love your ſelves, to deſiſt and proceed no further.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let all, that profeſs themſelves Members of Chriſt, learn, ſo to carry themſelves to Chriſt, as to their Head, and that in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us be obedient unto Chriſt, and ſubject to his Government, and guided by him in all things. So are all the inferior Members of the natural Body ſubject unto the Head, and guided and ordered by it. So ought we therefore to be to Chriſt, who is our Head, and the Church his Body, and we all Members in particular. Nor takes he this Honor unto himſelf, to be an Head to us, and over us; but <hi>God hath given him to be the Head over all things to the Church;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.22</note> he hath appointed him ſo to be: Yea, he, that is made our Head, is God as well as Man; therefore he hath right every way to rule and govern, and we have good reaſon to be ſubject: He hath the power of Life and Death, even of that which is everlaſting: Therefore let us be ſubject to him.<note place="margin">Matth. 17.5 Deut. 18.19</note> God requires this, <hi>Hear him.</hi> See that Threatening: <hi>Whoſoever will not hear my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will require it of him;</hi> namely, by puniſhment: and ſo the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it, <hi>I will take vengeance on him.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle expounds it:<note place="margin">Acts 3.23</note> 
                  <hi>Every Soul, that will not hear that Prophet,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115897:120"/> ſhall be destroyed from among the People.</hi> And ſee we not this fulfilled in the Jewiſh Nation? They would not hear Chriſt, nor be ſubject to him; nay, they ſaid, <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 19.14 1 Theſ. 2.16</note> and therefore (as the Apoſtle ſays) <hi>the Wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> Be we wiſe to take warning by them: Let us acknowledg the Relation between Chriſt and us, as between Head and Members, and accordingly render him due obedience, and be ſubject to him in all things: What he forbids, let us avoyd, as death; what he commands us, let us readily put it in execution: and let our Obedience be, not in ſome things onely, as we our ſelves liſt, but in every thing, ſuitably to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he hath preſcribed to us. Nor let us ſtand to conſult with fleſh and blood, but obey him readily, even in thoſe things which are moſt contrary to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Reaſon and carnal Wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt being our Head, let us aym at his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in all things, and prefer it before all things. We ſee, how chary the Members of the natural Body are of the good and welfare of the Head: how are they all, in their places, to further it, and to ſerve it? If one ſhall ſtrike at the Head, we ſee the Hand held up for the defence of it, ready to take the blow for the ſecuring of it. Let us bear the ſame affection to Chriſt our Head: let his Glory be dear and precious to us, even above our Eſtates, Liberties, Lives. What is againſt the Glory of Chriſt, let us ſet our ſelves againſt it with all our might; ſpare it not, how dear ſoever, or how advantageous ſoever it may be unto us. Sin is that, which in its own nature is moſt diſhonorable to Chriſt, let us therefore ſet our ſelves againſt it; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to make Laws againſt it, and to puniſh for it; Miniſters, to cry it down, and every man for his own particular to avoyd it; be it the Sin of our Age,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115897:121"/> Calling,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.29, 30 Galat. 5.24 Coloſ. 3.5</note> Conſtitution, <hi>though as our right Eye,</hi> as <hi>our right Hand,</hi> let us not make dainty of it, <hi>crucifie it, mortifie it,</hi> pull it out, cut it off, caſt it from us. What we finde to be for the Glory of Chriſt, let us promote and further it to the utmoſt of our power. Onely ſtill let Order be obſerved: Let us not run out of our places, nor forſake our ſtations, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of honoring Chriſt, leſt we diſhonor Chriſt by that, by which another man may honor him, doing that, which is within the compaſs of his Calling. But, ſo far as we may, and keep our ſelves within our liſts, ſo far (I ſay) let us, with our beſt diligence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Glory of Chriſt, how dear ſoever it may coſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatſoever degrees of ſpiritual Life we have, or whatſoever abilites to do good, let us not take it to our ſelves, but aſcribe all to Chriſt: for he is our Head, from whom all ſpiritual Life and Motion is conveyed unto us, let us therefore ſo acknowledg it.

This is Chriſts expectation, let us not fruſtrate it.

               </p>
               <p>So that in this Reſemblance is excellently ſet forth the ſingular love, and the tender affection, that our bleſſed Saviour bears to all godly Chriſtians, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weak Chriſtians, as an Hen to her Chickens, as a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115897:122"/> Mother to her Children: He gave great proof of it, while he lived on the face of the Earth: How did he tender his weak Diſciples? How did he bear with them, while they bewrayed their ignorance, and weakneſs of Faith, and other infirmities? And this it was that was propheſied of him:<note place="margin">Iſai. 42.</note>

Fear ſo, as to be circumſpect and watchful over our ſelves, not to give him advantage againſt our ſelves: but fear not ſo, as to deſpair of our ſafety: Chriſt is at once tender over us, and infinitely able to ſhelter and defend us.</p>
               <p>Much leſs ſhall we have need to fear viſible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who are fleſh and blood as we are: if Chriſt be ſo able to defend us againſt the Devil, how ſhall he not be able to ſafe guard us againſt his Imps? fly but to Chriſt, and get under his wings, as the Chickens under the wings of the Hen, and we ſhall be ſafe; let our Enemies be never ſo ſtrong, never ſo watchful, never ſo malicious: and there will be nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that we may ſay with <hi>David; In the Lord I have put my truſt,</hi>

                  <hi>I John,</hi> ſaies the holy Apoſtle, <hi>ſaw the holy City, coming down from God out of Heaven, as a bride prepared for her Husband.</hi> And, <hi>come hither,</hi> ſaies the Angel,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.9</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambes wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The marriage indeed is not fully conſummated, till after death, but the contract is made, and Chriſt and his Church are betrothed each to other: and among men, we know, that after the contract, the parties, affianced one to the other, are Husband and Wife, in the account of God.</p>
               <p>And for the further clearing of this, we are to know, that (though, in ſome things, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yet) in many things there is a great ſimilitude between the marriage of man and wife, and that of Chriſt and the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I ſay, there is a difference, between them in two particulars, in which the marriage between Chriſt and the Church hath the pre-eminency.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The marriage between man and wife ſtands in a carnal and bodily conjunction, but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church is myſtical and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Death breaks the bond between Husband and Wife: but it breaks not the marriage knot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Church: nay, its not fully finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till after death; it is before death but as the ſtate of a contract.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:115897:126"/>II. But yet, if we view it well, there is, and we ſhall finde, at leaſt in ſubſtantials, a great ſimilitude between them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In marriage there muſt be a conſent of both parties, and of the Parents on both ſides: and for want of this, as much ſin and diſorder hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſo we have ſeen great inconveniencies to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: thus therefore we have ſeen it to be in the firſt marriage, that ever was, namely, that between <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> ſee full conſent manifeſted on all ſides: here is the common Father of both:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.22</note> 
                  <hi>for having made Eve of the rib taken out of man, he brought her to the man:</hi> ſee the conſent of the woman, for the original word tranſlated, <hi>he brought,</hi> ſignifies properly, <hi>he cauſed to come,</hi> ſhe came then, and by coming ſignified her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: and Man manifeſted his conſent by receiving her, and ſaying,<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>this is now fleſh of my fleſh and bone of my bone.</hi> And this law we ſee ſtrictly obſerved in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between Chriſt and his Church.<note place="margin">Joh. 6.37</note> 
                  <hi>All that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives to me,</hi> behold the Fathers conſent! <hi>ſhall come to me;</hi> behold the Churches conſent! <hi>And him,</hi>

                  <hi>that comes unto me, I will in no wiſe cast out:</hi> behold Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In marriage there is a conjunction of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, One man and one woman; one <hi>Adam</hi> and one <hi>Eve</hi> in the firſt marriage: <hi>he brought her,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.24.</note> behold one <hi>Eve! to the man,</hi> behold one <hi>Adam!</hi> And ſee that law of marriage: <hi>Therefore ſhall a man leave,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp;c. and cleave to his</hi> wife, behold one of each: <hi>and they twain ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Indeed Polygamy was brought in by <hi>Lamech,</hi> and practiſed by, and permitted, or at leaſt winked at in them by God: <hi>but from the beginning it was not ſo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 19.8 Verſ. 4.5 Mal. 2.15</note> ſaies our Saviour; but God made them male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, namely, one of each, <hi>and ſaid, they twain ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> And this is obſerved by the Prophet, <hi>Did he</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:115897:127"/> not make one? a queſtion implying a vehement affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: he did make one: namely, one woman for one man. And ſo is it in this ſpiritual mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.6</note> and the Church: <hi>there is one Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and one Catholick Church, ſaies the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. And ſo ſaies our Saviour, <hi>my dove,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 6.9</note> 
                  <hi>my undefiled is but one.</hi> There are indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny individual believers, and many particular viſible Churches, but all theſe make one body, one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and one Spouſe; as the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>The body is one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12</note> 
                  <hi>though the members many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Marriage is to be between two fit perſons. <hi>I will make him an help,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.18</note> (ſaies God) <hi>meet for him.</hi> And what fearful inconveniencies have we known to follow upon unequal Marriages? whether the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality hath been in Age, Eſtate, or Religion. But what ſhall we ſay to this? Indeed, if we conſider Chriſt in himſelf, and us in our ſelves, the inequality is ſo great, that there is no fitneſſe, he God, we men; he Infinite, we finite, he Light, and we darkneſſe; he the wiſdome of the Father, we fooles; he purity it ſelf, we all filthy and uncleanneſſe as the Prophet ſaies,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.4</note> 
                  <hi>wallowing in blood, not waſhed at all, &amp;c.</hi> he the mirror of Beauty, we black dowdies; he infinitely glorious, we moſt baſe. But yet (that there might be ſome meetneſſe) he imparts ſomething to us, in which we might be like unto him, and in ſome things he partakes with us, in which he might be like unto us; he partakes of our nature,<note place="margin">Heb. 2 16 Verſ. 16. 2 Pet. 1.4</note> namely, <hi>of fleſh, and blood for he took the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> and <hi>he makes us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Divine Nature,</hi> namely, by infuſing into us by his ſpirit thoſe eminent perfections, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our meaſure, which are in God nothing but God.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:115897:127"/>IV. There is a great ſimilitude in regard of the ends of Marriage, which are two:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was not good for Man to be alone:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.18</note> ſo neither was it convenient, that Chriſt ſhould be without his Church, nor the Church without Chriſt; as not the Head without the Body, nor the Body without the Head: now Chriſt was from all Eternity appointed to be the Head of the Church, and the Church to be his Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Marriage is for the increaſe of Mankinde: ſo by the ſeed of Chriſt, that is, by his Word and Spirit, and by the help and Miniſtry of the Church, there is a great increaſe of that Seed, which is to inherit Heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">V. After Marriage the Woman leaves her own Name, and is called by the Name of her Husband, and is intereſſed in his Eſtate and Honor: ſo is it in this Marriage between Chriſt and the Church.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12</note> 
                  <hi>So is Chriſt,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle: and ſo the Members of the Church are called Chriſtians, by which name they were called firſt at <hi>Antioch:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 11:26</note> and ſo they are Partakers of that anointing, in reſpect of which he is called Chriſt:<note place="margin">Pſalm 45.7 1 John 2.20 Heb. 1.2</note> 
                  <hi>He was anointed with the Oyl of gladneſs above his fellows: And we have received an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy One.</hi> So <hi>Christ was made Heir of all things;</hi> and <hi>we are made Coheirs with Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.17 John 20.17 Luke 1.35 2 Cor. 6.18 John 1.12</note> 
                  <hi>If God is Christs Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is alſo our Father.</hi> If <hi>Chriſt be the Son of God, we alſo are his Sons and Daughters,</hi> though in a different manner; he by Nature, and we by Adoption; and this we have from and by Chriſt;<note place="margin">Matth. 4.11 Heb. 1.14</note> 
                  <hi>He hath given us power to be called the Sons of God.</hi> If <hi>the Angels miniſter u to Christ, they do alſo miniſter unto us.</hi> And, if he hath a Throne of Glory, on which he ſits in Heaven, we ſhall alſo ſit with him: ſo ſays our Saviour, <hi>To
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115897:128"/> him that overcomes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.21</note> 
                  <hi>will I give to ſit with me on my Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may learn ſundry things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Hence ſee the great Honor of the Church, and the Members of it: Behold! they are the Spouſe and Wife of Chriſt, and he is their Husband; tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Honor and Preferment! It could not be denyed to be great Honor that was put upon <hi>Eſther,</hi> ſhe a poor captivate Jewiſh Maid to be made the Wife of King <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> that had the command of 127 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: but how great then is the Honor that is done to the Church, in that Chriſt vouchſafed to be an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to her? for what is <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> or any the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Commander of the Earth, in compariſon of Chriſt? Behold!<note place="margin">Pſalm 24.7 1 Cor. 2.8 Acts 7.1 Rev. 19. &amp; 1.5 Prov. 8.16</note> He <hi>is the King of Glory, the Lord of Glory, the God of Glory, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords; the Prince of the Kings of the Earth:</hi> and, finally, <hi>He, by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice.</hi> See your great Honor ariſing from the Honor of your Husband: See his great Love to you in raiſing you to ſo high Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p n="2">II. See what comfort this point affords to all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, the Members of the Church. If he be our Husband, and we his Spouſe, then doubt not, but he will ſtrictly perform to us all the loving Offices, in a ſupereminent way, which loving Husbands do, and all Husbands are bound to perform to their Wives. So that the comfort reaches far. It's comfort,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Againſt bodily and ſpiritual wants: be ſure, ye ſhall not want any thing, that is for your good and conveniency, either for Soul or Body. The loving Husband readily ſays to his beloved Wife, Thou ſhalt not want any thing, ſo long as I have a peny: So ſays Chriſt much more to his Church; be of good chear then: whatſoever the wants be, under which ye
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115897:128"/> lie, do but by prayer acquaint Chriſt with them, and he wants neither will nor power to ſupply them all: not will, for his love to you is tranſcendent; not power, for all things are in his hands to beſtow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againſt our Sins: They are debts, but, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting heartily of them, be not afraid, leſt they ſhould be layd to our charge; our Husband will not fail to diſcharge them all for us: and, he having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them, and ſatisfied Gods Juſtice for them, doubt not, but that (though they be never ſo many, and never ſo great) they ſhall be remitted to you for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Againſt the Diſtreſſes, to which in this life we are ſubject, either from Men, or Devils: The loving Husband, if he be able, will be ſure to defend his beloved Wife from all wrongs: much leſs ſhall ye ſuſtain from any, if Chriſt your Husband can do with all: and what cauſe have we to doubt of his power? for God, <hi>the Father of Christ, is greater then all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.29, 30</note> 
                  <hi>and he and his Father are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Againſt all Enemies bodily or ghoſtly: Ye are ready to think, Our Enemies are great for power, full of policy, many for number, how ſhall we, an handful of impotent and ſilly men, be able to ſtand againſt them? but fear them not: Our Enemies are Chriſts Enemies, as the Wives Enemies are the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Enemies: and though they are more then our match, yet they are far inferior unto him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though we cannot, yet he can both ſhield us againſt them,<note place="margin">Iſai. 10.12</note> and <hi>render unto them the fruits of their ſtout hearts,</hi> and deſperate malice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Againſt our ignorance and ſimplicity: We are, in ſome particular or other, puzzled, ſo that we know not what to do, nor what courſe to take: Yet be not diſheartened, the Husband that loves his Wife,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115897:129"/> will be ready to direct and counſel his Wife, ſo far as he is able: Chriſt is ſuch an Husband, as wants neither will nor skill; he can direct us: for he is the Wiſdom of the Father,<note place="margin">Col. 2.3</note> and <hi>in him are all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg;</hi> and there is no queſtion but he will do it: for, beſides that he exceeds in love to his Church,<note place="margin">Iſai. 9.6</note> it's his Office to be <hi>a Counſeller</hi> to the Church, and to all godly Chriſtians, the Members of the Church: onely ſeek his advice by prayer, and ſearch the Scriptures, and doubt not but that thou ſhalt finde full direction, as your occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Againſt the baſe Opinion that the World hath of you: They think of you (as they of the Apoſtles) as <hi>the filth of the World, and the off-ſcouring of all things:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.13</note> and your condition, indeed, in the World, is mean and low, in which regard men proudly overlook you: So that ye may take up the complaint of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>We are exceedingly filled with contempt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 123.3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but be of good chear: See the Honor that Chriſt hath put upon you, while he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes your Huſband, and hath made you his Spouſe: and there is not the meaneſt Chriſtian, how much ſoever he is undervalued, but he hath a ſhare in this Honor.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Againſt ſpiritual Deſertions: Good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will not forſake their Wives; no Huſband ſhould do it, but ought to have one Bed and one Board with them: then be ſure, that Chriſt will not depart from thee; if he ſhall at any time ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, it's for thy good, and he will again return unto thee at the laſt, and will ſhew thee his favor; be comforted therefore. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a ſweet Paſſage to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:<note place="margin">Ne timeas, O Sponſa, ne desperes; ſi pauliſper tibi ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahit Sponſus faciem ſuam, omnia iſta tibi cooperantur in bonum; &amp; de acceſſu, &amp; de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſu, lucrum acquiris: tibi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, tibi recedit: venit ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolationem, recedit ad cautelam, ne magnitudo conſolationis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollat te, ne, ſi ſemper apud te ſit ſponſus, contemneres ſodales, &amp; hanc continuam viſitationem non jam gratiae attribuas, ſed naturae.

                  </note> 
                  <q>Fear not, O Spouſe (ſays he)
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115897:129"/> deſpair not; If, for a little while, thy Huſband withdraws his face from thee, all this works together for thy good; both by his coming, and by his departure, thou art a Gainer: He comes for thy good, and he departs for thy good: He comes for thy comfort, and he departs for thy caution; leſt the greatneſs of the comfort ſhould too much lift thee up; leſt, if thy Huſband ſhould be alway with thee, thou ſhouldſt contemn thy Companions, and ſhouldſt now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this continued Viſitation, not to Grace, but to Nature. <hi>Too much Familiarity breeds Contempt:</hi> He withdraws himſelf therefore, leſt, being too conſtantly with us, he ſhould be contemned, and that, being abſent, he may be the more deſired; and that, being deſired, he might be ſought with more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that, being long ſought, he may be found with more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Beſides, if we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want this comfort (which yet, in reſpect of the future Glory, is but ſomething in part) we would haply think to have here a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing City, and the leſs look for that which is to come. Leſt therefore we ſhould miſtake the place of our Exile for our Country, the earneſt Peny for full Payment, our Huſband comes and goes, one while bringing comforts, and another while
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115897:130"/> turning our whole ſtate into weakneſs, ſuffering us, for a little ſpace, to taſte how gracious he is; and, before we can have a full taſte of it, he is gone.</q> This then is no ſmall comfort to us againſt ſuch Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Let wicked men learn hence, not to deſpiſe godly Chriſtians, conſidering the Honor that Chriſt hath put upon them, in that he becomes their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and makes them his Spouſe: How were it not againſt all Reaſon to lade them with ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, whom the King of Kings hath ſo highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored? as for any of the Subjects, high or low, to have deſpiſed <hi>Eſther,</hi> when <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> had made her his Wife, and Queen in ſtead of <hi>Vaſhti.</hi> Much more let not them offer any wrong to ſuch: for Chriſt is their Huſband, and they are his Spouſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ſhall not the wrong done to them fall upon the head of the wrong doer? As the Huſband, that loves his Wife, will reckon any wrong done to her, as done againſt himſelf, and will to his power avenge her quarrel:<note place="margin">Eſth. 7</note> (And this we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Eſther; Haman</hi> had plotted the Deſtruction of all the <hi>Jews</hi> in one day; and ſhe, being a Jeweſs, had been in the ſame danger: and now ſhe had no ſooner complain'd to <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhueroſh</hi> of the wrong intended at the Banquet of Wine, but inſtantly his wrath was incenſed againſt <hi>Haman;</hi> nor could his wrath be pacified, till <hi>Haman,</hi> his great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, was hanged upon the Gallows, which he had provided for <hi>Mordecai:</hi>) So and much more will Chriſt, the Huſband of the Church, be affected with any wrong done to the Church, or any Members of it; he will own it, as done to himſelf, his wrath will be kindled againſt them that do the wrong, and a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge will certainly be taken upon them. As then ye love your ſelves, repent of, and deſiſt from wronging theſe.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:115897:130"/>IV. Let the godly learn, in this reſpect alſo, to look to their Converſation, that it may be ſuitable to the Honor that Chriſt hath put upon them; for ſo honorable carriage becomes honorable and honored perſons: It's not for a Kings Wife to give way to ſuch behavior, as may yet be tolerable in Women of ordinary rank; much more ought Chriſtians, profeſſing themſelves to be ſo related to Chriſt, to be choyce of their demeanor, as Chriſt, in the point of Honor, ſurpaſſes all the Grandees of the World.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Let them alſo learn to be thankful to Chriſt, who hath ſo honored them, becoming an Huſband to them: conſider we how great the Honor is, to be the Wife or Spouſe of the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: Think we, how unworthy we are ſo great advancement: and ſo endeavor we to raiſe up our hearts to an high pitch of thankfulneſs: And let us ſhew it forth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In words, by ſetting forth his Goodneſs, and ſounding forth his Praiſes.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Let us be ſubject to him, to his Injunctions by Active Obedience; and, by Paſſive, to all the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his Providence.</p>

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:115897:131"/>3. Let us have common Friends and common Foes, common Contentments and common Diſlikes: He counts our Friends his, and the acts of Friendſhip done unto us, he reckons as done to himſelf: It's his voyce,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.40</note> 
                  <hi>In as much as ye did it to one of theſe little ones, ye did it to me:</hi> He counts our Foes his, and the acts of Friendſhip denyed to, and the acts of Hoſtility done againſt us, he holds, as denyed to, or acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf.<note place="margin">Verſe 45</note> Thus he ſays, <hi>In as much as ye did it not to one of theſe little ones, ye did it not to me.</hi> And when <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> goes on to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Chriſtians, he hears it ſaid to him from Heaven,<note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul, Saul, Why doſt thou perſecute me?</hi> What then can we do leſs, then to count his Friends ours, and his Enemies ours. And, ſeeing he takes content in the things that make for our happineſs, and diſlikes the things that make againſt us, what is more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then that we ſhould take content in the things that content him, and diſlike and abominate the things that are diſpleaſing to him?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us be loyally affected unto him: let him have our love, all our love: So ought the Wife to be affected unto her Huſband; let us love nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, but for him: love not any man, but either becauſe he is Chriſts, or that by our love we may win him to be Chriſts: let us not go a whoring after other things, not love any thing, by which we may be in danger to be drawn from the love of Chriſt; nay, in compariſon of Chriſt, hate all.

If they be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent each from other, ſhe is glad of a Letter from him, and ſhe delights in reading it over and over. If they be preſent, its her joy to eat and drink with him to ſpeak to him, and to hear him ſpeaking to her. Let us not fail to be ſo affected to Chriſt: he is, in regard of his body, abſent from us: he in Heaven, we on Earth, and the Scriptures are, as his Epiſtle written to us, let us delight in them, and exerciſe our ſelves in the ſtudy of them: thus is the bleſſed man deſcribed, <hi>his delight is in the Law of the Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>and in that Law he meditates day and night.</hi> In the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper we have opportunity to feaſt with Chriſt, let us readily lay hold on all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for the uſe of this ordinance in the ſeaſon of it: let us diligently hear the Word read and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: therein Chriſt ſpeaks unto us. And finally, let us frequently put up our prayers to Chriſt, therein we ſpeak to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us long for the time, when this marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church ſhall be fully accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for ſo a woman betrothed to an Husband longs for the marriage day.

               <p n="1">1. Its an uſeful and profitable creature, the fleſh, the skin, the wool, yea all of it and about it is good for ſome uſe or other, for food, for cloathing, &amp;c. And who ſees not, how all this is true of Chriſt? uſeful he is for all purpoſes, he is a King to govern us, a Prophet to teach us, a Prieſt to Sacrifice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us; he is a Shepherd to lead us to the green Paſtures, a Phyſitian to heal our Diſeaſes, a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to adviſe us, a Guide to direct us,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55 1. Rev. 3.18</note> a Captain to fight for us: <hi>He is milk, wine, and hony; he is gold to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich us, garments to cloath us, eye-ſalve to cure our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> yea <hi>he is all in all to us;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.11</note> yea all about him is uſeful to us, the holineſſe of his conception to anſwer for our natural uncleanneſſe, the holineſſe of his life to anſwer for the irregularities of our lives, his Death to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for us: his Reſurrection, to be a cauſe of our reſurrection at the laſt day: His Aſcenſion into Heaven, to prepare Manſion-places for us, his ſitting at his Fathers right hand, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us; his coming again at the laſt day to take us to himſelf, that we may be ever with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lamb is a contented creature, content with any paſture, though never ſo poor, into which the ſhepherd ſhall put it: And who ſees it not to have been ſo with our Saviour? If God will have him to be born of a poor Virgin, he diſdains it not. If to live in a mean condition, ſo as not to have where to lay his head, he ſticks not at it: he ſought not greater things for himſelf then God had laid out for him; nay <hi>when the people would have taken him by force to make him a King,</hi> he would none of it,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.15.</note> but <hi>departed into a mountain alone by himſelf.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. Chriſt and the Light.</head>
               <p>CHriſt is frequently ſet out by this Reſemblance: The Evangeliſt ſays of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; <hi>The ſame came to bear witneſs of that Light:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1.7</note> and who was it, to whom he came to bear witneſs, but Chriſt? He adds;<note place="margin">Verſe 8</note> 
                  <hi>He</hi> (namely, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt) <hi>was not that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſs of that Light.</hi> But how then ſays our Saviour of this holy Baptiſt,<note place="margin">John 5.35</note> 
                  <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining Light,</hi> and of his Apoſtles in general, <hi>Ye are the Light of the World?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.14</note> The Anſwer is facile and eaſie: <hi>John</hi> was a Light, or as it were a Candle, or a Torch,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> giving Light to men; but he was not that Light. The Apoſtles were ſaid to be <hi>the Light of the World;</hi> but Light enlightened, whereas Chriſt is the enlightening Light, as the Evangeliſt proceeds to ſay concerning Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 1.9</note> 
                  <hi>He is the true Light, that enlightens every man that comes into the World.</hi> So was not <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, nor the Prophets, nor any other man, but Chriſt alone. Therefore he alone takes it to, and ſays it of,<note place="margin">John 8.12</note> himſelf, <hi>I am the Light of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this, as <hi>Janſenius</hi> well obſerves, agrees to Chriſt, both as God, and as Man: <q>For according to his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is the Light,<note place="margin">Secundum divinam naturam lux eſt, quia ſecundum eam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum mentes occultis ſuis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis perſtringit, ſuggerens, quae ſunt juſta &amp; ſalutaria: Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum humanam item naturam lux eſt, quia, in aſſumpta hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitate, verbo ſimul &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo, fugatis ignorantiae &amp; peccatorum tenebris, docuit &amp; demonſtravit, quae ſunt juſtitiae &amp; vertutis. <hi>Concord.

                     </note> becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it he dazles the mindes of men with his hidden beams, and ſuggeſts thoſe things that are juſt and ſaving. And, in regard of his Humane Nature, he is the Light, becauſe in his aſſumed Humanity,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115897:137"/> both by word and by example, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away the darkneſs of Ignorance and ſins, he hath taught and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the things that belong to Juſtice and Vertue.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame Author further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,<note place="margin">Emphatice dicit, Ego ſum lux mundi, ſignificans, praeter ſe, neminem eſſe lucem mundi, &amp;, ſi quis ſit, per ipſum eſſe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatione ſcilicet ſui luminis, ratione cujus Apoſtolos dixit eſſe lucem mundi.

                  </note> 
                  <q>That Chriſt did emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſay, <hi>I am the Light of the World;</hi> ſignifying, That, beſides himſelf, none is the Light of the World; and that, if any other be a Light to the World, he is ſo by him, namely, by partaking of his Light: in which reſpect he ſaid, that his Apoſtles are <hi>the Light of the World.</hi> He ſhews, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Light of the World, as who enlightened onely a ſmall part of the World, and onely with a dim Light, not as a Sun, but as a Candle. He notes alſo, that neither the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, the Teachers of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> nor the Phariſees, the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were the Light of the World, as who did rather caſt darkneſs upon the World, then drive it away from the World; and that he alone is that to the whole World in ſpiritual, which the viſible Sun is in bodily reſpects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the Reſemblance holds in ſundry Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Light receives no pollution; though it ſhines on a dunghil, or on any place moſt loathſom and filthy, yet it remains ſtill pure and untainted. So our Saviour, though he came to a ſinful World, as to a ſtinking dunghil, or a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of dead mens
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115897:138"/> ſkulls, yet he retained his purity ſtill; he converſes with Phariſees, with Publicans and Sinners, yet is not infected by them: many of them were bettered by him, he not liable to be corrupted by any of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Light is a common benefit; no people is there to whom it is appropriated; no people excluded from the comfort of it: it ſhines upon all, there is no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly, no ingroſſing of it. So is Chriſt a common benefit to all Believers of all Nations, of all ranks and degrees, to <hi>Jews,</hi> to <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to high, to low, to rich, to poor, to Maſter, to Servants, to male, to female, to learned, to unlearned. So ſays the Apoſtle: <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal 3.28</note> 
                  <hi>there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Every man therefore is invited unto him,<note place="margin">Iſai. 55.1</note> with promiſe to receive benefit by him: <hi>Ho, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that thirſts</hi> (ſays Chriſt by the Prophet) <hi>come, buy of me Milk and Wine:</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Light expels Darkneſs: ſo doth Chriſt expel the darkneſs of Ignorance: When Chriſt came into the World, he drove out the Darkneſs that was in the World before, and brought in a clearer Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, then had been formerly in the World: <hi>Life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 2.3</note> And, when Chriſt comes firſt into the Soul, he findes all covered with a worſe then an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs; and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18</note> That <hi>they had their underſtanding darkened:</hi> but he diſpels this Darkneſs, ſetting up, yea, being a Light in our Souls: In which reſpect St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Epheſians, Ye were once Darkneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.8</note> 
                  <hi>now ye are Light in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We hear what our Saviour ſays:<note place="margin">John 12.37</note> 
                  <hi>He that walketh in Darkneſs doth not know whither he goes.</hi> And again: <hi>If a man walks in the night, he ſtumbles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 11.10</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe there is no Light in him: but he that walks in the day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 9</note> 
                  <hi>ſtumbles not, becauſe he ſees the Light of the World.</hi> And, as it is for going, ſo it is for action; In the dark a man knows not what he doth, but Light directs, as the Foot in walking, ſo the Hand in working. In this alſo Chriſt reſembles the Light. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> while <hi>Saul,</hi> being a ſtranger from Chriſt, who wonders to ſee him guilty of groſs miſcarriage?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13 Gal. 1.23 Acts 9.1 Acts 8.3</note>

                  <hi>He preaches the Faith, which once he destroyed;</hi> He tenders the Flock of Chriſt, of which formerly he had made havock. And ſo we may ſee it to have been with others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Light is a pleaſant thing:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.7</note> 
                  <hi>Truly the Light is ſweet</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon) and it's a pleaſant thing for the Eye to behold the Sun:</hi> And,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.30</note> 
                  <hi>The Light of the Eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces the Heart,</hi> ſays he. And hence Light is put for Joy: <hi>Light is ſowen for the righteous,</hi>

                  <hi>and Joy for the upright in Heart.</hi> And thus doth Chriſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Light; as <hi>Janſenius</hi> well obſerves: <q>We

See the fearful folly, of which they are guilty that refuſe to accept of Chriſt, when he is offered, and offers himſelf to them in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: it is thus with many: haply, might they have him upon their own terms, might they keep him and the World together, might they keep him and their ſins together, they would be perſwaded eaſily to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him: but the caſe ſo ſtanding, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep both together, they bid adieu to Chriſt: Oh the folly of theſe men! for now they, rejecting Chriſt, refuſe to accept of Light, and chooſe rather to live in the dark: and how ſhall they avoyd ſtumbling and falling? And when croſſes and afflictions betide them, where ſhall they finde comfort to uphold them, while they refuſe Chriſt, in whom alone all comfort ſtands? who ſhall wonder, if ſuch as theſe fall into deſpair? who ſhall wonder, if ſuch, in extremity of ſorrow, offer violence to Nature, and prove cruel to themſelvs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. See how comfortable the condition of them is, that have an intereſt in Chriſt, that can ſay, as the

Having him ye ſhall walk, ſurely, and ſafely, ye ſhall be ſecured againſt falling and ſtumbling, ye ſhall be guided and directed by him in the ordering of your ſteps. Having him ye ſhall be ſure in him to finde comfort againſt all diſtreſſes, which may happen to you, whether in body or in minde: againſt <hi>Satan,</hi> he hath vanquiſht him in himſelf, <hi>and he will tread him under your feet:</hi> againſt the world,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20 Joh. 16.33</note>

               <p n="3">3.

                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:115897:140"/>4. Let us learn, not to contemn and deſpiſe God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, between whom and us there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great diſtance in outward reſpects: though they be poor and we rich, they deſpicable, we honourable, &amp;c. yet deſpiſe them not, but own them as brethren, and give them the right hand of fellowſhip: remembring, that as the benefit of the light belongs in common to all creatures, ſo the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Chriſt to all Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Gal 3.28</note> and though in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects, there be never ſo great difference between us and them, yet <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt we are all one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Are we in our places Lights, communicating Light to others, inſtructing them in the knowledge of God and of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.9</note> guiding them by the light of our example? yet let us walk in all humility: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Chriſt alone is that true light, enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every man, that comes into the world:</hi> and if we be Lights, we are but enlightned Lights: and the light, which we impart unto others, we have it not of our ſelves, but from Chriſt the light of the world: Why then ſhould we be proud?<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. As Chriſt being the light of the world, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his light unto us, inſtructing and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, ſo let us, having recieved light in any kinde from Chriſt, impart our light unto others for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; having been taught by Chriſt, and inſtructed in any truth, let us readily teach and inſtruct others: be not we niggards of our knowledge, but readily communicate it to others.

               <head>CHAP. XII. Chriſt and a Phyſician.</head>
               <p>OUr bleſſed Saviour, for converſing with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners, was excepted againſt by the Phariſees:<note place="margin">Matth. 9.11</note> 
                  <hi>Why eats your Maſter</hi> (ſay they) <hi>with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners?</hi> Our Saviour anſwers this Cavil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways: His firſt Anſwer is taken from a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,<note place="margin">Verſe 12</note> 
                  <hi>The whole need not the Phyſician, but the ſick.</hi> His Argument ſtands thus; No place is fitter for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but where men are that need his help, as being ſick: but I am a Phyſician, Sin is a ſickneſs, theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans labor under this ſickneſs; therefore no place is fitter for me, then where theſe Publicans and Sinners are: Therefore to cavil at me, for converſing with Publicans and Sinners, is equally unreaſonable, as if any ſhould cavil at a Phyſician for being with ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons So that it's manifeſt, that here our Saviour ſpeaks of himſelf, as a Phyſician.</p>
               <p>And indeed the work of a Phyſician is done by Chriſt, therefore he doth not unfitly reſemble himſelf to the Phyſician. The Antecedent is manifeſt; for what work is more proper to the Phyſician, then to heal diſeaſes, and to cure the diſeaſed? and this was done by Chriſt, as is manifeſt in the Hiſtory of the Evangeliſts;<note place="margin">Matth. 9 35 and 4.23, 24</note> 
                  <hi>He went about, healing every ſickneſs and every diſeaſe among the people,</hi> ſays Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> And ſo it's propheſied of him,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.2</note> 
                  <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe with healing under his wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the things that are required in a Phyſician are eminently to be found in Chriſt: 1. Knowledg of the Diſeaſes, of the Cauſes and Cure of them: and who can
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115897:145"/> deny but that this was tranſcendently in him? 2. Carefulneſs: and this was in Chriſt in an eminent proportion. 3. Pity: Chriſt hath a fellow-feeling of our infirmities. 4. Painfulneſs: This was in Chriſt, as may appear by his manifold Travels from one Town to another for this end.</p>
               <p>But there is great difference between Chriſt and other Phyſicians: in all which we ſhall ſee Chriſt to have the pre-eminency; ſo that it will eaſily appear, that we may ſay (without prejudice to <hi>Galen, Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> or any other Phyſician of the greateſt note that ever have been) that Chriſt is The Phyſician, by way of eminency, The incomparable Phyſician; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of whom, the greateſt or moſt eminent of that profeſſion may (without diſparagement to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) confeſs, that they are not worthy to carry his Books after him; or, in the words of that holy Baptiſt,<note place="margin">Luke 3.16</note> that <hi>they are not worthy to unlooſe the latchet of his ſhooes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Other Phyſicians cure onely the Diſeaſes of the Body: but he is the Phyſician that cures the Diſeaſes of the Body, and alſo of the Soul, to which latter none of our Phyſicians do attain. Excellently Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> to this purpoſe: <q>Mankinde (ſays he) labors under a threefold Diſeaſe, our Nativity, Life,<note place="margin">Triplici morbo laborat genus humanum, nativitate, vita, &amp; morte: nativitas immunda, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta perverſa, mors periculoſa. Venit Chriſtus, &amp; contra tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem hunc morbum triplex attu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit remedium; natus eſt enim, &amp; vixit, &amp; mortuus eſt: Ejus nativitas purgavit noſtram; mors illius deſtruxit noſtram, &amp; vita ejus inſtruxit noſtram. <hi>Lib. ſentent.</hi>
                     </note> and Death: our Nativity unclean, our Life perverſe, our Death danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Chriſt comes, and againſt this threefold Diſeaſe hath brought a threefold Remedy: for he was born, he lived, and he dyed: his Birth cleanſed ours, his Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed our death, and his Life hath inſtructed ours, and ſets it right.</q>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:115897:146"/> Then is Chriſt a compleat Phyſician of our Souls. And to this, as no Phyſician, ſo no man, nothing can lay any claim. See the Confeſſion of Saint <hi>Macarius:</hi>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115897:146"/> all the reſt of that ceremonial righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was celebrated in the Law; and yet by them all could not the Soul be healed or cleanſed, till the Saviour came, who is the true Phyſician, and heals freely.</q> And the ſame Truth is atteſted by him in many other places.<note place="margin">Hom. 30, 44, &amp; 45</note> And now what a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is this between Chriſt and other Phyſicians? and how great is his eminency above them, in that he healed the Diſeaſes of the Body as well as they; and alſo the Diſeaſes of the Soul, to the curing of which, neither they, nor any other, can or ever could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</p>

               <p n="4">4. Phyſicians working cures, perfect them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: a diſeaſe may be cured, but weakneſſe remains a long time after: a bone broken or diſ-joynted is ſet, but its not preſently ſtrong: a wound may be healed, and yet a ſcar remains. But Chriſts cures were perfected preſently.<note place="margin">Luk. 4 38, 39</note>

               <p n="5">5. Other Phyſicians are chargeable and coſtly, they will not ordinarily do any thing without their fee, not ſpeak a word, not write a line, not ſtirre a foot out of doores, though the neceſſity of the Patient be never ſo great: Its noted of the woman, that bad the iſſue of blood twelve yeares,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.43.</note> that though ſhe was never the better, yet ſhe had ſpent all her ſubſtance upon Phyſicians. But its farre otherwiſe with our bleſſed Saviour; whom he undertook to cure, he certainly healed them, and yet its true of him that St. <hi>Macarius</hi> ſaies of him, <hi>Curat gratis, he beales freely,</hi> not expecting any fee, not taking any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as its plain in the hiſtory of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:115897:148"/>
               <p>Hence we may learn divers things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See what a great benefit Chriſt is, how he ſerves for all uſes. If we be hungry, he is bread to nouriſh us: and ſo in the reſt: And, for the particular in hand. If we be ſick or wounded, in ſoul or body; he is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to heal and cure all our maladies: how great is the love of God to us, in that he gives Chriſt to us thus uſeful to all purpoſes?</p>

               <p n="3">3. Let us, labouring under any malady or diſeaſe, in ſoul or body, fly to Chriſt by prayer, to be healed

               <p>OUr Saviour ſpeaks of himſelf, as ſuch, and of the godly, as his ſheep. <hi>I am the good Shepherd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.11 Verſ. 14.</note> ſaies he, <hi>the good Shepherd gives his life for his Sheep.</hi> And again, <hi>I am the good Shepherd, and know my Sheep.</hi> And ſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of him.<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.11.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shepherd.</hi> And ſo the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> brings him in, ſaying, <hi>I will ſearch my Sheep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 34.11, 12, Heb. 13.20</note> 
                  <hi>and ſeek them out, as a Shepherd ſeeks out his Sheep.</hi> So doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of him, <hi>The God of peace, that brought again from the dead the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the great Shepherd of the Sheep.</hi> And ſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of him:<note place="margin">1 Pet 2.25. 1 Pet. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>now ye are returned to the Shepherd and Biſhop of your ſouls.</hi> And again, <hi>When the cheif Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd ſhall appear, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reſemblance holds excellently between Chriſt and a Shepherd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Shepherd knowes his own ſheep from the ſheep of other men: and to this purpoſe is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſheep: ſo is it with Chriſt: ſo ſaies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord knows who are his.</hi> And ſo ſaies our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>I am the good Shepherd, and I know my ſheep:</hi> The good and bad are in this world mixt together, yet he knowes, who are the ſheep belonging to him; yea, whereſoever they are, he doth know them, and their eſtates: he knew <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon, the three children in the fiery Furnace, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the inner priſon, he knew the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:115897:149"/>2. The Shepherd is careful in feeding and paſturing his ſheep; he leads them not out to rotten grounds, that may bane them, but into good and wholeſome paſtures, on which they may thrive. Such care hath Chriſt for his people, his ſheep: he feeds their bodies with material food,<note place="margin">Exod. 16.4</note> See how he fed <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, becauſe they wanted means of Tillage, he fed them with Manna from Heaven:<note place="margin">Exod. 17.6</note> and becauſe it was a dry Wilderneſſe, he gave them water out of the Rock. See how he fed <hi>Eliah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 17.6</note> when he was fain to fly from <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel:</hi> the Ravens bring food to him, and the brook <hi>Cherith</hi> furniſheth him with drink:<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> and when the waters of the Brook failed, he ſends him to the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> the meal of whoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and the oyl in her cruſe he lengthens out, that it might ſuffice for the ſupport of the Prophet, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and her Son, till he ſent rain on the earth:<note place="margin">1 King. 19.5, 6.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he made the Angels his Purveyors to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide food for him. And ſo ſtill he provides food for us, yea for all creatures. <hi>Theſe all wait upon thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.15</note> ſaies the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> Much more will Chriſt provide food for his people: ſee the promiſe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.18, 19</note> 
                  <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, to keep them alive in famine.</hi> So he feeds their ſoules with ſpiritual food, Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and his fleſh and blood in both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Shepherd (knowing the ſtraying nature of his ſheep) is the more careful and watchful over them to keep them together. Hear what <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Thus I was in the day, the drought conſumed me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 31.40.</note> 
                  <hi>and the froſt by night, and my ſleep departed from my eyes.</hi> And ſo it is ſaid of thoſe Shepherds,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.8</note> that <hi>they watched their flocks by night.</hi> Such is the care that Chriſt hath for his ſheep, his people, to keep them from going aſtray: hence it is, that he gives ſuch frequent warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115897:150"/> againſt thoſe ſins and errors, by which they are in danger to miſcarry: ſuch as that of the wiſe man, <hi>My Son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.10 Matth. 7.15</note> 
                  <hi>if ſinners entiſe thee, conſent thou not;</hi> and that of our Saviour, <hi>Beware of falſe teachers, which come to you in ſheeps-cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.2.3</note> And that: <hi>what they,</hi> the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat, <hi>bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do, but do ye not after their works, for they ſay and do not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24.4</note> And that. <hi>Take heed, that no man deceive you.</hi> And that of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16.17</note> 
                  <hi>Mark them that cauſe diviſions among you and avoid them.</hi> And that, <hi>Beware leaſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col 2.8. 1 Theſ. 5.21 1 Joh. 4.1</note> 
                  <hi>and vain deceit, &amp;c.</hi> And that, <hi>Try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> And that of Saint <hi>John. Believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, whether they be of God or not.</hi> All theſe warnings ſhew Chriſts care over his ſheep, to keep them from going aſtray.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſhepherd is careful to defend his ſheep againſt the incurſions of Wolves and other enemies: hear what <hi>David</hi> ſaies of himſelf to <hi>Saul. Thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant kept his fathers ſheep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>and there came a Lion and a Bear, and took a Lamb out of the flock, And I went out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him and ſmote him, and delivered it out of his mouth.</hi> That of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> (which he indeed turns to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe) is apt to this purpoſe. <q>The Wolf comes to the ſheepfold, he ſeekes to ſeize on ſome ſheep,<note place="margin">Venit lupus ad ovile ovium, quaerit invadere, jugulare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorare: vigilant paſtores, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant canes: nil poterit, non aufert, non occidit. <hi>To. 10. de Verb. Apoſt. ſer. 19.</hi>
                     </note> to kill, to devour it, but the ſhepherds are watching, and the dogs are barking, and now the Wolf can do nothing, he takes not away, he kills not.</q> Such care hath Chriſt for his ſheep, for his people: he watches over them to defend them againſt all enemies, bodily and Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Pſal. 121.3, 1</note> 
                  <hi>He that keepeth thee, will not ſlumber, Behold, he
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115897:150"/> that keeps Iſrael, will neither ſlumber nor ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſhepherd, if any of his ſheep be weak and tender, how tenderly doth he care for them, and ſo for the young Lambs, ſo Chriſt for his people:<note place="margin">Iſa 40.11</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall gather the Lambs with his arm,</hi> ſaies the Prophet, <hi>and carry them in his boſome, and gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> The poor younglings he will tenderly relieve and ſupport them. So was it Propheſied of him.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.3</note> 
                  <hi>The bruiſed reed he will not break, nor quench the ſmoaking flax.</hi> Its a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a diminutive ſpeech, much more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, then is expreſt. <hi>He will not break, he will not quench,</hi> that is, he will encourage weak beginnings, he will foſter and nouriſh them, and carry them on to higher degrees, till the bruiſed reed growes ſtrong,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.20</note> till the ſmoaking flax breaks out into a flame. And this is by the Evangeliſt applyed to our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Shepherd, if any of his ſheep go aſtray, takes courſe to bring them home again, he uſes his whiſtle, he ſends out his dog. Such care hath Chriſt for his ſtraying ſheep: He calls to them in the miniſtry of his word, as to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 3.1 Verſ. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return to me:</hi> and, <hi>Return, ye back-ſliding children, and I will heal all your back-ſlidings.</hi> And he makes uſe of afflictions, as his dogs, with which he hunts his ſtraying ſheep to the flock. Thus when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will go after my lovers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.5 Verſ. 6 Verſ. 7. Hoſ. 5.15</note> God threatens <hi>to hedge up her way with thornes, &amp;c.</hi> till ſhe ſhould ſay, <hi>I will return to my firſt husband.</hi> And ſo he ſaies, <hi>I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ſeek my face, in their afflictions they will ſeek me early.</hi> And ſo it followed, <hi>Come,</hi> ſaid they,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.1</note> 
                  <hi>let us return to the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath ſmitten and he will binde us up.</hi> And ſo <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks in his own experience.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119 67</note> 
                  <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:115897:151"/>7. If any one ſheep be miſſing and loſt, how doth the Shepherd,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.4, 5, 6</note> leaving the flock, ſeek after the loſt ſheep, till he finds it? and having found it, how doth he bring it home on his ſhoulder rejoycing? how doth he invite his friends and neighbours to rejoice with him? So is Chriſt affected in this reſpect: and this he ſhewes in the Parable of the Prodigal; When he came to his Father, how lovingly was he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?<note place="margin">Luk. 15.20</note> for, <hi>when he was yet afarre off, his Father ſaw him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and had compaſſion on him, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him: he ſaid alſo to his ſervant bring the best Robe and put it on him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>and a Ring on his hand and ſhoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted Calf, and kill it:</hi> what joy was there at his entertainment?<note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>for there was muſick and dancing.</hi> And the Elder Brother, at his coming from the field was offended at this: we ſee how the Father juſtified this his rejoycing.<note place="margin">Verſ. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>It was meet,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that we ſhould make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again: he was loſt and is found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt apt therefore is this reſemblance of Chriſt to a Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Hence we may learn divers things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. See here the ſafe and ſecure eſtate of all godly Chriſtians, having Chriſt to be their Shepherd, who is ſo tender, and watchful over them, for now they cannot poſſibly miſcarry, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeakes excellently.<note place="margin">Sape vexatur Eccleſia, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam tamen poteſt ſuſtinere naufragium. <hi>To. 1. lib. de So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomone.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Againſt the fear of want: why ſhould we fear it, having ſuch a Shepherd? He is able to provide
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115897:152"/> for us,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2</note> for <hi>He is made the Heir of all things:</hi> and, if the good Shepherd hath a care for the paſturing of his ſheep, Chriſt cannot be wanting herein to his ſheep: There is therefore nothing to hinder, but that we may comfortably conclude with <hi>David,</hi>

                  <hi>The Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, I ſhall not want.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Labor to know your Flock, and the ſtate of it:<note place="margin">Prov. 27.23</note>

               <p n="2">2. Be careful to feed the ſheep of Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care, with ſound Doctrine, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Example:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.2 Ezek. 34:2</note>

               <p>But yet he is called a ſtone becauſe he is like a ſtone.</p>

In general: for ſtrength.<note place="margin">Job 6.12</note> This is eminent in ſtones: and therefore holy <hi>Job</hi> could ſay, <hi>Have I the ſtrength of ſtones?</hi> much more is this eminent in our bleſſed Saviour, he is called by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.

               <p n="2">2. In Particular. I. There is <hi>lapis angularis,</hi> the corner ſtone, and that is Chriſt: and beſides the places

               <p n="1">1. In Chriſt there is a conjunction of Heaven and Earth, God and Man, Creator and creature, finite and Infinite: theſe two ſo different are in Chriſt made one Perſon, as by means of the corner the two ſides of a building become one building.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Church by means of Chriſt there is a conjunction of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> both are made one and held together by Chriſt, as the Head of both, they are in and by him made <hi>one Body,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. There is <hi>Lapis fundamenti,</hi> a ſtone for a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a Rock, upon which the Houſe being built ſtands impregnable againſt all opoſition of waves, winds,<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.16 Matth. 16.18</note> and rain.

                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:115897:156"/>III. There is <hi>Lapis refugii,</hi> a ſtone of refuge: ſuch is a Rock in the Sea, to a man, that is in danger of drowning: he haſtes to it, and gets upon it, and ſo is ſafe againſt his danger: And ſuch is Chriſt to all, that (being in danger to be over-born with any temptation of Satan, and ſo to be overwhelmed in the Sea of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair) do lay hold upon Chriſt by a true and lively faith: they finde that in Chriſt by which they are held up in hope of mercy, and ſo ſaved from the danger of deſpair.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is <hi>lapis offenſionis, &amp; petra ſcandali</hi> a ſtone of offence, and a Rock of ſcandal: as a Rock in the Sea, againſt which a ſhip daſhes her ſelf and ſo is broken to pieces: or a ſtone in the ſtreet or high way, at which a man, or horſe, not ſeeing, or not minding it, ſtumbles and falls, and endangers himſelf, or the horſe himſelf,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.15.16</note> and his rider: So is Chriſt as ye have heard, to all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>Jewes, Pagans, Hereticks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.8</note> and all wicked livers among Chriſtians: how have they found Chriſt to be ſuch unto them? Look upon the Hiſtories of the Church, and we ſhall finde plentiful examples of this in all kindes: And this is another reaſon (which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that Imperfect work upon Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> gives) why Chriſt is called a ſtone, namely, <q>Becauſe there is in Chriſt a great power to break to pieces all his wicked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;<note place="margin">Quia in Chriſto magna eſt iniquorum confractio: Sicut enim omnis res, quae percutit lapidem, ipſa quidem colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, lapidem autem non lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: ſic &amp; omnis, qui Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem perſequitur, ſe quidem corrumpit, Chriſtianitati au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non nocet. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> for as every thing that ſtrikes a ſtone, it hurts not the ſtone, but is it ſelf broken to peeces: ſo the enemies of Chriſtian Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail ſo farre, as to hurt it, but they mainly hurt themſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence learn we divers things</p>
               <p n="1">1. See here the difference between the Church of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115897:157"/> old Teſtament, and the Church of the New: or as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, between the Synagogue and the Church. The former did conſiſt of <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, the latter of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> together. of the former its ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.1</note>

                  <hi>You onely have I known of all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4 Eph 2.14 Pſal. 118.22</note> But <hi>in the fulneſſe of Time God ſent his Son,</hi> who by his death <hi>broke the middle wall of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition down,</hi> and riſing again, <hi>is made the corner-ſtone,</hi> making <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> one body, one new man, &amp;c. And, whereas God is onely worſhiped in the Church, the Propheſy of <hi>Malachy</hi> is now fulfilled,<note place="margin">Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>That from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame the Name of the Lord is great among the Gentiles, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place incenſe is offered up, and a pure offering.</hi> So that now,<note place="margin">Rom, 10.12</note> as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>There is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. See the ſad eſtate of all the enemies of Chriſt: ſuch as there have been, and are many in the world, <hi>Jewes, Pagans, Hereticks,</hi> ill-living Chriſtians: they kick and ſpurn againſt Chriſt, rejecting him, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Religion, perſecuting his members, refuſing to be ruled by his Lawes: thus they do, but what do they get by it? nothing but wo and ruine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So a ſhip daſh't againſt a Rock is broken to peeces; ſo a man violently kicking againſt a ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall gets nothing by it, but the wounding of his feet: Chriſt is a Rock, they that kick and ſpurn againſt him, what can follow upon it but their own ruine?
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115897:157"/> we may ſee this in the experience of all times: And if any feel it not here, but continue to proſper, while they continue to oppoſe Chriſt, moſt fearful is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſuch hereafter; A time ſhall come, and is coming, when (as they now ſay,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>we will not have this man to raign over us,</hi> ſo) they ſhall hear it ſaid to them, <hi>As for thoſe my enemies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that would not have me to rule over them, bring them hither and ſlay them before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. See what comfort belongs unto all godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Chriſt is the ſtone for the Foundation, and a ſure Foundation he is, to uphold the building: no cauſe therefore have they that are built upon this Rock, to fear the oppoſition of all the powers of hell, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 16.18</note> they may ſhew their teeth, they may heave and ſhove againſt them, to caſt down this building: but all in vain, it ſhall ſtand, and all that are built upon this ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, ſhall ſtand, maugre their malice. Chriſt is a ſtone of Refuge: as a Rock in the Sea, ſaving a man from drowning, that gets upon it: Be of good cheer therefore, ye that by a true and lively faith lay hold upon him: the Devil ſeeks to drown you in the ſea of deſpair, but he ſhall not prevail in this his deſign: ye may finde that in Chriſt, which may fence you againſt this danger. Satan will ſet before you your manifold violations of Gods righteous Law, and Gods infinite Juſtice, in reſpect of which he will ſuggeſt to you, that it is impoſſible for you to be ſaved: but in Chriſt ye ſhall finde your debts diſcharged, and Gods Juſtice infinitely ſatisfied: ſo that though look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at your ſelves in your ſelves, ye can ſee nothing but a neceſſity of periſhing, yet looking at Chriſt, ye may have a certainty of Salvation, ye caſting your ſelves upon Chriſt by faith, and heartily repenting
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115897:158"/> of your ſins, by which ye have offended God. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Chriſt is the corner-ſtone, making <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> one body and one ſheepfold, this may well comfort us <hi>Gentiles</hi> againſt the inſultations of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> they inſult over us, as having no intereſt in God, becauſe we are not of them: but let not this trouble us: though in former times we were as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, yet now Chriſt hath made room for us in the Church, and we believing, have as good an intereſt in God, as ever the <hi>Jewes</hi> had.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us learn hereafter not to oppoſe Chriſt, not in Himſelf, not in his Religion, not in his Ordinances, not in his Members: If we do, ſuch oppoſition will coſt us dear; no other then our ruine, can be the fruit of it: As we therefore, love our ſelves, let us deſiſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us caſt our ſelves upon Chriſt for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo ſhall we be impregnable againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us <hi>Gentiles</hi> praiſe God for his mercy, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son to dye for us, by which he hath taken away the Law of Commandments contained in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and ſo breaking down the middle wall of partition, and by his Reſurrection making him the chief corner-ſtone, by whom it comes, that we <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were once farre off, are now made neer, and become fellow-citizens of the Saints and of the houſhold of God.</p>

                  <hi>that fear my name, ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſe.</hi> In which place (as is acknowledged by all Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) promiſe is made to the godly of the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh. And ſo Saint <hi>John</hi> ſets out the Church <hi>as a woman clothed with the Sun,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.1</note> with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the reſemblance holds in many particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sun hath no ſpots, though the moon may have: ſo the Church and the members of it have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity remaining in them: for the work of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is onely begun in this life, and the height of a Chriſtian, while he lives in this world, is onely a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe towards perfection of Holineſſe. Of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, while he lives here its true, that the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>The fleſh luſts against the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17</note> 
                  <hi>and the Spirit againſt the fleſh:</hi> therefore while we live here we have a mixture of fleſh and ſpirit, old and new man, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and grace,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> as <hi>Rebeccah</hi> had two contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in her womb: we muſt, ſo long as we live, give our ſelves to the exerciſe of Mortification,<note place="margin">Col. 3.5</note> 
                  <hi>Mortifie your members that are on the Earth,</hi> that is, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore there are remainders of impurity in the beſt men, which is the ſubject of this mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And while we live here, we are tyed to that precept, <hi>Grow in Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3 18</note> therefore the work of Grace and Holineſſe is imperfect in us all: for perfection and growth are inconſiſtent. Finally, its moſt true that

                  <hi>In many things we offend all;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are in us remainders of impurity. Thus is it with the beſt men. But, with him its farre otherwiſe. <hi>He was and is holy,</hi>

                  <hi>harmleſs, undefiled.</hi> Conſidered as God, he is infinitely holy, incomparably holy, <hi>There is none holy, as the Lord.</hi> So its true of him that Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaies,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.5</note> 
                  <hi>He is light and in him there is no darkneſs.</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as man, he is perfectly Holy: the Holy Ghoſt Sanctified the womb of the Virgin, and ſtopt the courſe of Original ſin, that it ſhould not diffuſe it ſelf to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, therefore he is called <hi>That Holy thing:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 1.35</note> and hence it was, that His Life was ſin-leſſe, ſo that he could appeal to his enemies, <hi>Which of you convinces me of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sun drives away darkneſſe, and enlightens the World: ſo doth our bleſſed Saviour by his Goſpel outwardly and by his Spirit inwardly, drive out the darkneſſe of ignorance, and enlighten our mindes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly to know God, and the things that concern our everlaſting happineſſe.<note place="margin">Joh. 1.9</note>

               <p n="4">4. The Sun gives, as light, ſo heat and warmth to the creatures on the earth, and ſo is an inſtrument, to further their growth: So Chriſt warmes our hearts by the expreſſions of his love unto us. Who, that is ſo much as ingenuous, hearing, or thinking, what Chriſt out of his love to us, hath done or ſuffered for us, hath not his heart burning within him? who doth not grow in love to God, to Chriſt, to his
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115897:159"/> Brethren in this reſpect? To be ſure, this Love of Chriſt hath an aptneſs to produce theſe effects in us: We hear the inferences, that that beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple made in this kinde; <hi>We love him,</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> And, <hi>If God hath ſo loved us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 11</note> 
                  <hi>we ought alſo to love one another.</hi> And Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſerious conſideration of Chriſts Love ſo warmed his Heart, that he doubted not to pronounce that dreadful ſentence, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22</note> 
                  <hi>let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sun purges the Earth, Water, and Ayr, by exhaling and drawing up the Miſts and Fogs that are in them: ſo doth Chriſt ſanctifie the Soul, and purge the Heart: This is attributed to Chriſt;<note place="margin">Eph. 5.26</note>

               <p>Hence we may learn ſundry things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt is fit to be a Saviour to us, and an High Prieſt for us, in that he was and is ſo tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently pure &amp; unſpoted:<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26</note> for <hi>ſuch an High Prieſt it became us to have, who was holy, harmleſs, undefiled:</hi> had he been in any degree polluted with corruption, and defiled with ſin, he had been ſo far from having been a meet Saviour for us, that he ſhould have needed ſome other to have been a Saviour for him, or he ſhould have needed <hi>to have offered ſacrifice firſt for his own ſins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 27</note> 
                  <hi>and then for the peoples,</hi> as it was with the Levitical Prieſts. Nor had he been fit to have been a Sacrifice for us: for all the Creatures, that were to be ſacrificed under the Law, were to be without ſpot and blemiſh: But behold he is tranſcendently pure! then was he an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Saviour, Prieſt, and Sacrifice.</p>

                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:115897:160"/>2. See what a Gift Chriſt is, ſurpaſſing all other Gifts that God gives to the Sons of men: for behold the great conveniencies that accrue to us by him: To know God and Chriſt, how great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is it?<note place="margin">John 17.3</note> for <hi>this is Life Eternal.</hi> To have comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the ſaddeſt accidents that can befall us, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable is it? And to be made holy and pure, what a conveniency is it? for without it the beatifical Viſion of God is not to be expected; <hi>Without it</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>we cannot ſee God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.14</note> and having it, we cannot miſs of it:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.8</note> for, ſays our Saviour, <hi>The pure in Heart ſhall ſee God.</hi> Behold! all theſe we have from Chriſt, this Sun of Righteouſneſs: How unparalleld a Gift then is He, that comes ſo attended? How great the Love of God in beſtowing ſuch a Gift upon us? How can we then be ſufficiently thankful for ſuch Love?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatſoever degree of Holineſs any of us attain unto, let us yet vail the Bonnet unto Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg our own nothingneſs in compariſon of him: for, though we are never ſo much before others, yet we are infinitely behinde Chriſt: As for us, are we holy? yet we are many degrees ſhort of that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which we ſhall at laſt attain: Are we holy? yet the Holineſs which we have is not without ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of impurity, witneſs the blemiſhes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: but the Holineſs of Chriſt, even as Man, was perfect, and it was pure, there was no ſpot in him. Entertain not therefore any high thoughts of our ſelves, but be we raviſh'd with an admiration of Chriſt; and, in compariſon of him, let us confeſs with <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi>

But, that he might bring forth more fruit, he was planted in the Earth, conceived in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> made that which he was not, [namely, Man,] and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining that which he was [name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God.]</q>

                  </note> 
                  <q>The fruitful Vine uſes to be pruned: And Chriſt was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, not that he needed this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but leſt he ſhould ſeem to break that Law which himſelf had given.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And, before he goes any further, he notes here two things, as the Uſes of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Exhortation. <q>That if at any time we ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin,<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <q>Let us (ſays he) comfort our ſelves in our pains, who at no hand are without ſin, and yet are ſet free by his pains,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115897:162"/> who ſuffered pain, and was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for himſelf, but for us; not for himſelf, but that he might heal our wounds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then he adds:</p>

                  <note place="margin">Aliter etiam praeciditur vitis noſtra: omnia enim ab eo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſa dicamus, quibus in hac vita caruit, cum ea tamen habere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuiſſet: Phil. <hi>2.7.</hi> ipſa exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio praeciſio erat: ſicut enim minuitur vitis, cum praeciditur, ſic Chriſtus incarnatione mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus, &amp; infra omnes homines humiliatus eſt.

                  </note>
                  <q>And otherwiſe alſo was this our Vine pruned: for we may conceive all thoſe things pruned off from him, of which he was deſtitute in this life, when as yet he might have had them. <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation, Phil.</hi> 2.7. this very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inanition was a pruning: for as the Vine is diminiſhed when it's pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo Chriſt by his Incarnation was made leſs then, and humbled below all men. Glory was cut off in him by the Knife of Ignominy, Power by the Knife of Abaſement, Pleaſure by the Knife of Pain, Riches by the Knife of Poverty. He, that was Glory it ſelf, is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, that he was reckoned the baſeſt of men. He is ſubjected to ſo great Pain, that he might ſay, as the Church, <hi>Behold, and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: (Lament.</hi> 1.12.) He was ſo poor, that, himſelf being Judg, he was found poorer then the very Foxes and Birds of the Ayr: for he could ſay, <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the ayr have neſts, but the Son of man hath not whereon to reſt his head: (Matth.</hi> 8.20.) He
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115897:162"/> was poor in his Birth; for, being born, his food was the Virgins Milk, his Covering vile Rags. He was poorer in his Life; for, if he had wherewith to cover him, he was oft ſhort in his Victuals. He was moſt poor on the Croſs, where ye might have ſeen him naked, and thirſting. Laſtly, By the Knife of Fear all his Friends were cut off from him, ſo that he had none to comfort him. What Vine was ever ſo pruned?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Oh the great Humiliation of our dear Saviour! How great was his Love to us, which drew him ſo voluntarily to ſubmit himſelf to ſuch and ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement for our good? Why ſhould we think much to ſtoop to any abaſement for his Glory, who firſt thus far humbled himſelf for us?</p>
               <p n="3">III. <q>The Vine is digged about. This digging ſignifies the fraud of Enemies laying ſnares to entrap:<note place="margin">

                     </note> for he doth, as it were, dig a pit, who ſeeks to deceive another with craft. So was it done to our Vine, namely, Chriſt: <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.6. <hi>This they ſaid</hi> (ſays the Evangeliſt) <hi>tempting him, that they might have whereof to accuſe him.</hi> Theſe wicked Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen digged about our Vine, not to make it to flouriſh, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wither: But, being thus digged about, contrary to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, it was made more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and diſtilled the juice of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But, ſeeing that their diggings about did not hurt our Vine, they at laſt labored to dig through our Vine, that it might, as it is with
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115897:163"/> other Trees, wither for ever: They digged his hands and Feet, and his ſide with the cruel Spear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See the malice of Chriſts Enemies againſt him: ſee we what things they acted againſt him; they ſeek in his life-time to enſnare him: and, towards the cloſe of his life, what did they not act againſt him? and yet they could not but ſee, that he was more then a man:<note place="margin">John 7.46</note> 
                  <hi>Never man</hi> (ſay the Servants of the Phariſees, that were ſent to apprehend him) <hi>ſpake like this man:</hi> and the people, beholding his Miracles, could ſay,<note place="margin">Mark 7.37</note> 
                  <hi>He hath done all things well.</hi> And yet all this could not reſtrain, nor ſet bounds to their malice. Why then ſhould we wonder at the rage and malice of Enemies againſt us?<note place="margin">Luke 23.31</note> 
                  <hi>If theſe things</hi> (ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>be done to the green Tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.25</note> And, <hi>If they have called the Maſter of the Houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of the Houſhold?</hi> And, if we feel the effects of Enemies malice againſt us in any kinde, let us comfort our ſelves with this, That it's no otherwiſe with us, then it was with our Lord and Maſter; remembring what our Saviour ſays,<note place="margin">Verſe 24, 25</note> 
                  <hi>The Diſciple is not above his Master, nor the Servant above his Lord: It's enough for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be as his Master, and for the Servant to be as his Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſee here alſo, how vain and impotent the malice of Chriſts Enemies againſt him was: They ſought to entrap him in his words, but ſee, how, from time to time,<note place="margin">John 8</note> he eſcaped the danger; as, when the Phariſees brought the Woman to him, whom, they ſaid, they had taken in the act of Adultery: And when they, with the <hi>Herodians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.15, 16</note> came to him with that queſtion, Whether it is lawful to pay Tribute unto <hi>Ceſar?</hi> In the former Chriſt gave ſuch an Anſwer,<note place="margin">John 8.9</note> as made them go away aſhamed, and, as it were, to ſteal away one
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115897:163"/> by one: and in the ſecond, his anſwer made them to marvel, and ſo to leave him.<note place="margin">Matth. 22.22</note> And when at laſt they came to dig through this Vine, they apprehended him, they brought him before the Tribunal Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, where he was condemned, as worthy of death, as a blaſphemer, and before the Civil State, where by their importunity, they prevailed to have him crucified, and there to dye, now they thought, they had made this Vine to wither for ever, but their hopes in all theſe their deſignes were daſht, as Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſpeaks excellently:<note place="margin">Mors corporalis vicit ad tempus, ut vinceretur in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.

                  </note> 
                  <q>Bodily death (ſaies he) prevailed for a time, that it might be overcome for ever. Death was overcome, becauſe he roſe from the dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as it was with the malice of Chriſts enemies againſt him: ſo is it with the malice of the enemies of Chriſtians againſt them: that is alſo vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent: they threaten, they torment, they put to death, and now they hope to ſtrike fear into their hearts: but all in vain: ſo that its with them according to that of the Poet: <q>The plain Country-man, ſayes he, expects when the River ſhould run it ſelf dry,<note place="margin">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115897:164"/> for they were dead.</q> Well may we therefore be comforted againſt all the malice of enemies; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo weak; and well may enemies in this reſpect be aſhamed to go on in ſuch malicious courſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhall but ſhew their teeth, and all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

A certain King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded with an Arrow, when he was deſired, that he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be bound, till the head of the Arrow might be cut out, becauſe the leaſt ſtirring would endanger his life, returned this fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anſwer, It becomes not a King to be bound; a Kings power muſt be free and alway entire. Therefore, O God of Gods, what'a derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this to thy liberty and power? Thou art bound with ſo many bonds, who onely haſt the power to bind and looſe. But it is for thy mercies ſake, that thou art bound, that thou mayeſt ſet us free from all our miſeries. I wonder at it, O Lord Jeſus, and with wonder ſhould faint, but that I certainly know that thou waſt firſt tyed with the cords of love in thy heart, by which thou mighteſt more eaſily be drawn to the enduring of theſe worſer bonds.

So the Prophet ſpeaks of the Vine. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Shall wood be taken thereof for any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any veſſel thereon?</hi> Its a queſtion that implies a vehement Negation. So was it alſo in the body of Chriſt, according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. <hi>He hath no form nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty, that we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him.</hi> What is more manifeſt? And he was truly ſuch in the eyes of carnal men, that could look no further then the fleſh. And this we may prove by plain reaſons: firſt, by his compaſſion, then by his Paſſion. Who doth not know, that a man about his friend in danger, is moved with ſuch affection, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115897:165"/> grief that he prejudices his own body? If a man doth this for a man, what think we that Jeſus, God and man, doth for man? If thou for one man endangereſt thy ſelf by compaſſion, what thinkeſt thou that the Jeſus Lord endured for all men? But come we now to his Paſſion. And we ſpeak not now of the Paſſion of one day, in which he ſuffered death, but of his whole life: for Chriſts whole life was a continued Croſs and Martyrdome. See how he exceeded in Abſtinence, in Watching, in Prayer,: How aſſiduous in Labour and Sweating, when he went about their Townes and Villages, preaching the Goſpel and healing Diſeaſes every where. And how oft did he ſuffer Hunger and Thirſt, who is that Bread of Life, and that Fountain of Water, <hi>ſpringing up unto Eternal Life?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider we that Faſt of fourty daies and fourty nights, and let us now meet him returning to men from the Deſert, and conſider his lovely countenance afflicted with ſuch Faſting. Come we now to that conflict of the laſt day of his Life, and we ſhall ſee cauſes enough of the deformity of his body: ſee how he began to be amazed and aſtoniſhed:</q> 
                  <hi>My ſoul</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto the death.</hi> 
                  <q>A bloody ſweat
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115897:166"/> did in ſuch plenty bedeaw his body, while he was praying, that it did not alone diſtill, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fell by drops to the earth. Let us breefely run over the evils of that night, how he was apprehended, bound, drawn, thruſt, beaten, ſpit on and buffeted, &amp;c. and now what place was here for delicacy? what comlineſſe could be there? who could expect beauty in a body thus handled? Come we to the cloſe. Good Jeſus is ſtript ſtark naked; Wo is me! He that cloathed the Heavens with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stars, being to be crucified, is ſpoiled of his garments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now let us not be offended ſo farre at the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Chriſt in his body. Its that to which he ſubmitted himſelf for our good and Eternal advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks well. <q>From the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our Redeemer iſſued the price,<note place="margin">De deformitate Redemptoris noſtri manavit pretium eterni decoris noſtri. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                     </q> 
                     <q>How can the Son be the Word, or that Word the image of God? ſince the word of men, conſiſting of letters, is nothing but the diſcovery of the minde, and doth nothing, but diſcover the will of the ſpeaker, which being done, it inſtantly vaniſhes.</q> To this objection, I ſay, he returns this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <q>If they think that they ſpeak of an ordinary man, let them ſpeak of the Word of the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115897:172"/> Father, as much as they will after the manner of men: But if they ſpeak of God, the Creator of man, let them not entertain any humane thought, but think ſuch things, as are above humane nature: for, look, what the begetter is, ſuch is it neceſſary, that the thing begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be: and, what an one the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Word is, ſuch muſt his Word be.</q> And a little after he adds with reſpect to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in hand: <q>The word of men as it conſiſts of ſyllables, ſo neither hath it life nor power of acting, but is onely in the ſpeaker a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the minde, and aſſoone as its uttered, it inſtantly paſſes away, becauſe it was nothing, before it was uttered. But the Word of God is not enunciatory, nor a ſound of voices, nor a complexion of words: but look, what is the brightneſſe iſſuing from the light, ſuch is it, and a certain thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and that perfect out of a perfect, and therefore it is God, and the Image of God. Nor are we here to enquire, why the Word of God is not ſuch, as our words are; ſeeing God is in no ſort ſuch as we are.</q> And a little after he adds a further diſſimilitude between this Word of God and our words. <q>Men (ſaies he) have many words,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115897:172"/> frequently, and daily ſpringing up, and paſſing away, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words continue not, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a way. But the Word of God is one and the ſame, and as it is written, remains for ever without any change: for it is convenient that one God ſhould have one onely Image, one onely Word, one onely Wiſedome.</q> 
                     <hi>Fulgentius</hi> alſo ſets out the diſſimilitude in few words, while he ſayes thus. <q>Chriſt is a Word, not which being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vaniſhes, but, which being begotten remains:<note place="margin">Chriſtus eſt verbum, non quod deſinit prolatum, ſed quod permanet natum: non tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, ſed Eternum, non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum â Deo Patre, ſed genitum &amp; unigenitum. <hi>Serm. 2. de dupl. nativ.

               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> do joyntly and unanimouſly note two things, in which this reſemblance holds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the contemptibleneſſe of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the meaneneſſe of it; no creature is more baſe and contemptible then a Worm; every one is ready to tread upon it, and to trample it under foot; the pooreſt, the youngeſt dare venture to offer wrong to it. So was it with our bleſſed Saviour: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added in the forementioned ſcripture,<note place="margin">Pſal 22.6</note> 
                  <hi>A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of men and deſpiſed of the people:</hi> he ſubmitted himſelf to ſo mean a condition, that he was eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and reproached at all hands: <hi>He became poor:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9</note> and who takes not liberty to deſpiſe the poor? No wonder then, that our Saviour met with ſo much ſcorn: and ſo its foretold of him by the Prophet.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.3</note> 
                  <hi>He was deſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi> And, if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Evangelical Hiſtory, we ſhall ſee it to have been ſo with him, namely, that he was coarſely uſed:<note place="margin">Luk. 2.7</note> when he was to be born, no better place can be afforded him then the Stable and the Manger. When he came to his Publick Life, though he ſpake ſo,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.16</note> as never man ſpake, and though, in regard of his miracles, they could ſay, <hi>we never ſaw it ſo done in Iſrael.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Mar. 2.12</note> 
                  <hi>He hath done all things well:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7 37 6.3 Math. 13.35 Joh. 10.20</note> yet how ſcornfully did they uſe him? In words, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> and, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> And, <hi>thou art mad and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115897:174"/> haſt a devil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 7.20 Luk. 4.29</note> And no leſſe in deeds: <hi>they lead him to the brow of the hill, thinking to caſt him down head-long: they caſt ſtones at him:</hi> But eſpecially in the cloſe of his Publike Life,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.59 Matth. 26.50 Joh. 18.20 Matth. 26.57</note> then they laid hands on him, they bind him, they hurry him about, firſt they bring him to the High Prieſt, and there they ſpit upon him, they blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold him,<note place="margin">Verſ. 67, 68</note> and buffet him and then they ſay, <hi>Propheſie to us, who it is that ſmote thee:</hi> they deliver him over to the Secular Power,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.2 Luk. 23.7, 11</note> even to <hi>Pilate,</hi> he ſends him to <hi>Herod,</hi> who mocks him, and ſends him back again to <hi>Pilate:</hi> here the <hi>Jewes</hi> hire falſe Witneſſes againſt Him, they preferre a Murderer before him:<note place="margin">Matth. 27.21</note> the Souldiers plat a Crown of Thornes on his Head, they put on him a Purple Robe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 29.</note> and put into his hand a Reed, and mockingly bow the knee to him, and cry; <hi>Hail King of the Jewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 35.</note> they ſtrip him of his clothes, and crucifie him between two Thieves:<note place="margin">Verſ. 38.</note> And, being upon the Croſs,<note place="margin">Verſ. 39, 40, &amp;c. Verſ. 44.</note> they revile him <hi>and wagg their heads, &amp;c.</hi> yea, the very <hi>Thieves did caſt the ſame in his teeth.</hi> Juſtly therefore in this reſpect is he compared unto a Worm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the breeding of the Worm. <q>The Worm (ſaies Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>) which is bred in the Wood,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Vermis, qui in ligno naſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non habet patrem niſi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, &amp; Chriſtus ex maria na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt abſque coitu viri. <hi>To. 4. In loc.</hi>

                        <p>Cur totius creaturae Dominus vermiculo ſe voluerit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare? Poſſumus hoc humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti aſſignire, ſicut David publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ſe memoravit. Sed magis hoc accipiendum puto quod ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis nulla extrinſecus admixtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne alieni corporis, ſed de ſola &amp; pura terra procreatur, ideo illum comparatum Domino, quia &amp; ipſe ſalvator ex ſola &amp; pura Maria generatur. <hi>To. 3. conc. ad pop. conc. 3.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> hath no father, but onely a mother: ſo Chriſt was born of a Virgin without carnal copulation with a man.</q> Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> moves the queſtion, <q>Why the Lord of the whole World would compare himſelf to a Worm? and he anſwers. We may aſcribe this to his humility, as <hi>David</hi> called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Flea: but I rather think it to be, becauſe the Worm is gendred of the ſole and pure earth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115897:174"/> the mixture of any other body, therefore I think him to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our Lord, who alſo was born of a ſole and pure Virgin.</q> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in like manner, ſaving that in the former of the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, he brings in this latter reſemblance, with a <hi>Fortaſſe,</hi> an, <q>It may be: And,<note place="margin">Fortaſſe etiam propter Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum partum. <hi>ep. 49.</hi>
                     </note> it may be becauſe of his birth of a Virgin:</q> as doubting, whether this were in that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt intended: As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he well might, in regard of that which follows in that Verſe, <hi>A reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which is added as an Expoſition of the former clauſe, in which he had ſaid, <hi>I am a Worm.</hi> Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, its a plain Article of our Chriſtian Faith, not to be denyed, nor ſo much as queſtioned, but to be firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed: that Chriſt our Saviour was born of a Virgin.</p>
               <p>In regard therefore of the firſt particular we have cauſe to meditate of the great Humiliation of our dear Saviour, and conſequently of his ſurpaſſing love to us, in that he vouchſafed, for our good, to ſtoop ſo low: not onely he becomes man, but alſo a Worm. Its an excellent and juſt meditation of Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> to this purpoſe. <q>O Vouchſafement to be juſtly admired! Thou,<note place="margin">O admiranda dignatio! De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us immenſae gloriae vermis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibilis fieri non deſpexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti. <hi>De paſſ. Dom.</hi>
                     </note> that art the God of Infinite glory, didſt nor diſdain to be made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Worm.</q> What Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is comparable to this?<note place="margin">Jon. 3.6</note> It was a great humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> when riſing from the Throne he ſate in Aſhes, and putting off his Robe, he covered himſelf with Sackcloth. But its nothing to this: as there is no compariſon between the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one and of the other, and between the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115897:175"/> humbled: the one a King, the other the King of Kings, the one a weak creature, the other the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Creator: how great then is that love, which drew our Saviour to ſuch abaſement?</p>
               <p>And now, why ſhould it trouble us, if it doth ſo happen, that we are in the world, as Worms? Every man takes liberty to trample upon us, to inſult over us, to lade us with wrongs and injuries: but be of good cheer, it is no other wiſe with us in this reſpect, then it was with our dear Saviour: and he, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going it in his own perſon, hath ſanctified and ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to us, ſo that we may count it bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>And let this love of Chriſt, ſubmitting himſelf to ſuch abaſement for us, ſo farre prevail with us, as make us willing, to ſubmit our ſelves to any abaſement for him, for his cauſe and honour. Chooſe we rather to have all men to trample on us, and to be contemned and ſcorned at all hands, then to omit any duty, by which in our places we may honour him, or to take any courſe that may tend to his diſhonour: Hath the Lord ſuffered ſuch contempt for the ſervant? and ſhall the ſervant be unwilling to ſuffer contempt for his Lord and Maſter? God forbid: Such contempt ſuffered for his honour will certainly bring us to glory and honour everlaſting; which God of his mercy grant us for the merit of that contempt, which our dear Saviour hath undergone for us, to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt be all Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> notes yet another Particular, in which the Church reſembles the Ark: <q>The Flood ceaſing (ſays he) the Ark reſted upon a Mountain:<note place="margin">Ceſſante diluvio, arca in monte requievit: ſic hujus vitae corruptione ceſſante, cum malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum operum fluctus tranſierint, in coeleſti patria, in excelſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcet Eccleſia monte. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                  <p>But Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves one thing, in which the Church is more excellent then the Ark of <hi>Noah:</hi> for ſo he ſays, <q>A man may ſay, and not err,<note place="margin">

                        </note> That the Church is more excellent then the Ark: For the Ark received brute creatures, and kept them ſuch; but whom the Church receives, ſhe changes: As for example; A Kite went into the Ark, and it came forth a Kite; a Wolf entred, and came out a Wolf: But hath a Kite entered into the Church? it comes forth a Dove: Hath a Wolf entered? it comes out a ſheep: not indeed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture altered, but the wickedneſs exploded, and put away.</q> 
                     <hi>Saul,</hi> afterward bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, remains the ſame individual perſon that he was before; but yet, having entered, of a Wolf he becomes a ſheep, yea, a faithful ſhepherd of the ſheep; preaching, yea, ſuffering for the Faith which once he deſtroyed.</p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:115897:178"/>
                  <p>Hence learn ſundry things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us be prepared and diſpoſed to every good work, and firm in our reſolutions for it, that we may be fit matter for the Building of the Church, and may anſwer the <hi>Gopher</hi> Wood, of which the Ark was made.</p>

                  <q>The parts of the Tabernacle (diſtinguiſht each from other by the interpoſition of a vail) were not two contiguous houſes, but one continued houſe; to teach us, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> are joyned into one ſpiritual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and both People to grow into one Church: yet there was a certain vail interpoſed, becauſe the reſpect of that time did require, that the Ancient Church, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Legal Ceremonies, as by a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Wall of Partition, ſhould be diſtinguiſht from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But after that Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſneſſe ſhined out to the World, the ſhadowing Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies being diſſipated, the Vail of the Temple was rent, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 23.45.) and the middle Wall of Partition broken down. (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence learn divers things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Learn here, that in the Church God dwels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as with the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: and therefore let us be circumſpect and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115897:182"/> careful of our Converſation, that we do nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming his preſence, leaſt we provoke him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt us and move him in diſpleaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from us, as by the ſins of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> God was moved in diſpleaſure to forſake them: ſo ſhy are we, and careful to ſhun any thing that may drive away any uſeful friend from us, whoſe preſence and abode with us we have cauſe to deſire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See here the Church to be one, as the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was one:<note place="margin">Eph. 4.3</note> and therefore let us <hi>Endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> let us take heed of diſunion: Let us hearken to Saint <hi>Paul, We beſeech you brethren in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10</note> 
                  <hi>that there be no diviſions among you, but be ye perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde, and in the ſame judgement.</hi> Its Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that makes the requeſt to us, who was the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that did ſo much, and ſuffered ſo much for our behoof: good cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we to hearken to him: he might command in a buſineſſe of this nature, but he rather beſeeches us: yea, he beſeeches us in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of what weight ſhould his name be with us? And as for the thing it ſelf, Its laid down, 1. Negatively, let there be no diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you: and why ſhould we not hearken to him herein? for, who knows not of what dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence diviſions are in the Church? we hear what our Saviour ſaies,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>An houſe or Kingdome divided cannot stand.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> deviſe is a good one, of two Veſſels floating on the Sea, with this Motto, <hi>We are broken to pieces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Frangimur, Si collidimur.</note> 
                  <hi>if we daſh one againſt another.</hi> As then we tender the ſafety of the <hi>Church,</hi> let us take heed of diviſions. 2. Its laid down affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>be perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde and in the ſame judgement:</hi> that is, keep unity and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115897:182"/> maintain peace: this we ſhall finde to be of ſingular conveniency.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.11</note> 
                  <hi>Live in peace</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. See the gracious care of God for his Church to preſerve it againſt and from all dangers; as God provided for the ſafety of the Tabernacle a double Covering beſides the Curtains, namely, that of the Goates-hair, and that of Ram-skins died red: why then ſhould we be afraid of any dangers, having the wings of Gods protection ſpread over us? <hi>David,</hi> knowing, that <hi>the Lord ſuſtained him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 3.5, 6</note> reſolves <hi>not to be afraid of ten Thouſands of people, that ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt him round about.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.</note> And knowing that <hi>God was with him,</hi> he reſolves, <hi>to fear no evil though he walked through the Valley of the ſhadow of death.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we lye open to any danger, fly to God by prayer, and then fear not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See how we are preferred before the People of God under the old Teſtament: they had the Types, we have the Truth: they had the Shadowes, we have the Body: they had a threefold covering of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, that hindred them from ſeeing the very Types that were in it: yea there was a Vail that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the very ordinary Prieſts from beholding the things that were in the Holy of Holies, which yet were but Types of good things to come: but its otherewiſe with us, the Vail is rent, and now we may with open face behold the ſubſtance of all thoſe Types: Oh what preferment is this?<note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The myſtery was kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from the beginning, but now its made manifeſt:</hi> how ſhall we anſwer it to God, if, having ſo cleer a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we ſuffer our ſelves to be outſtripped by them?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us <hi>Gentiles</hi> praiſe God for his goodneſſe to us: we are admitted into and made one Church with the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115897:183"/> 
                  <hi>Jewes:</hi> we were once ſhut out of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the middle Wall of Partition, even the Legal Ceremonies: but now that Partition-wall is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and ſo we are now become <hi>Fellow-Citizens of the Saints:</hi> As the Holy and moſt Holy Place, though diſtinguiſhed by a Vail interpoſed, were yet one Tent, one Tabernacle, ſo believers of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> are become one Church, and one ſheepfold under one ſhepherd. Remembring therefore, what once we were, and what now we are by the grace of God, let us not fail to praiſe God for this happy change and high preferment, and his unſpeakable mercy expreſſed therein.</p>

               <p>Now the Church, being the true Church, holds out the Light (ſays my Author) two ways.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>Let it be the care of us all thus to reſemble the Candleſtick in the Tabernacle; as that held out the Light to others, ſo let us hold out the Light of Truth unto others: and that both theſe ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By teaching and inſtructing others in the Truth of Religion: In publique let the Miniſters of the Goſpel acquaint the people, committed to their care and truſt, with the Truths of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.2</note> 
                  <hi>preaching to them in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon:</hi> In this eſpecially

               <p>And in private, let this be the care of Heads of Families, thus to inſtruct and teach their Children and Servants: We hear how God ſpeaks of <hi>Abraham; I know that he will teach and command his Children and Houſhold after him to keep the Way of the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.19</note> and thereupon God reſolves, not to hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> the thing which he was about to do, namely, about <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>And let us learn to imitate God in the high eſteem which he hath of the Church, even of all godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and, as he doth, ſo let us account highly of them: This will be our wiſdom, to conform our judgment to the judgment of the onely wiſe God.

               </p>
               <p>Wo then to all that are voyd of Holineſs, that trade in wickedneſs, that wallow in the mire of their ſins: Theſe may live in the viſible Church, but they are not true Members of the Church: None can be Members of the Church, but they are withall Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt; and no ſuch unholy perſons can be Members of Chriſt, therefore neither can they be
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115897:186"/> Members of the Church: The diſtinction of true Members,<note place="margin">Membra vera, &amp; membra vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</note> and living Members, will not help them; for theſe are inſeparable: none can be true Members, except they be living Members. Wo to them then. Admirable are the priviledges of the Church, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, Forgiveneſs of Sins, Reſurrection of the Body, and Life everlaſting: but to them, that by their wickedneſs are manifeſted not to be Members of the Church, theſe priviledges do not appertain: How ſad then is their condition!</p>
               <p>But here is comfort to all that are truly holy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified by the Spirit of God, hating and mortifying the remainders of corruption, ſtriving to further degrees of Perfection, laboring to abound more and more in fruits of Righteouſneſs and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Such as theſe may and do lie open to mocks and ſcoffs in the World; but yet let them be of good chear: for this Work of Holineſs, wrought in them, argues them to be true Members of the Church: and from hence they may aſſure themſelves, That all the priviledges of the Church do belong to them; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Communion of Saints, by which, among other conveniencies, they have a ſhare in all the Prayers of the Churches of God throughout the World; and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins,<note place="margin">Pſalm 32.1</note> a Bleſſing ſo great, that Happineſs is affirmed to ſtand in it, and Reſurrection of the Body, and Life everlaſting; namely, Reſurrection to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life: And what Comfort is, or can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable unto this?</p>
               <p>True, ſays the poor Chriſtian, here were great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for me, if I could finde the Work of Holineſs in me in truth, but I fear it is not ſo with me, for I finde in my ſelf much corruption, and I ſin frequently in many things; how then ſhall I ſay, that the Work of Holineſs is wrought in me? To ſuch I anſwer, That
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115897:186"/> the Work of Holineſs may ſtand with remainders of corruption, and with many ſins in our life: for it's not Perfection, but Truth of Holineſs, that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: elſe where ſhould we finde any man in the World, that hath the Work of Holineſs in him? for <hi>Solomon</hi> could ſay, <hi>Who is he that lives, and ſins not?</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 John 1.8</note> 
                  <hi>he hath no ſin, he deceives himſelf.</hi> Thou complaineſt therefore of remainders of corruption, and of many ſtrayings in thy Life; but know, if ye grieve for them, and mourn under them, and ſtrive againſt them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them, this is the ſtate and condition of the Work of Holineſs that is in the beſt men living on the face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>As therefore we deſire to have a comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to our ſelves, That we are indeed Members of the Church, and that the fore-named priviledges of the Church do belong to us, let us labor to finde in our ſelves the Work of Holineſs in Truth; and <hi>let us</hi> (as the Apoſtle adviſes) <hi>be holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> in work, in word, in thought, in affection.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15</note> And as for that corruption that cleaves to us, let us mourn under it, and endeavor to mortifie it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent daily of our daily ſlips, and ſo make after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees of Holineſs continually, till we come to a perfect man, to the meaſure of the ſtature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Parts of this Candleſtick, which are of two ſorts: ſome were for Uſe, and ſome were for Ornament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The parts that were for Uſe, were the ſeven Lamps: <hi>Thou ſhalt make the ſeven Lamps thereof.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 25.37</note> 
                  <q>Theſe (ſays my Author) typified the manifold Graces of the Spirit of God, the number <hi>ſeven</hi> being a number

                  </q> And thus alſo doth <hi>Ainſworth</hi> open it, and makes good the Application by that of Saint <hi>John:</hi>

                  <hi>There were ſeven Lamps burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spirits of God.</hi>

               <p>Be we thankful to God for his great Mercy, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing us with thoſe Heavenly Graces, as pledges of the Spirit of God dwelling in us, as the Lamps were ſeated in the Branches of the golden Candleſtick.

               <p n="2">2. The parts that were for Ornament, were Knops, Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>And theſe did typifie the Care of God (ſays my Author) in beautifying and adorning his Church, and particular Chriſtians, the Members of it, with ſeveral Graces.</q> For ſo the Graces of Gods Spirit are of uſe, both for neceſſity, to fit us for the ſeveral duties which God requires of it; and alſo for ornament, to adorn our Souls, and to make them amiable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore be ſo much the more thankful for theſe Graces of the Spirit of God, which render us ſo acceptable unto God.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Church and a Body.</head>
                  <p>We have the Church frequently in Scripture ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as a Body; as where its ſaid, <hi>There is one Body:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.4 Verſ. 12. Verſ. 16.</note> and again, <hi>For the edification of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> And again, <hi>From whom the whole body, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the reſemblance between the Church and a Body ſtands in ſundry things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the unity of the whole.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12</note> The members of the natural body are many and divers, and their offices
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115897:190"/> divers, yet they all make but one body, being all knit together by ſinews, joynts, nerves. So the members of the Church are many and divers in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reſpects, yet they make onely one body, one Church, they being all knit together in one (as by ſinewes and nerves) by ſundry bands, the band of one Faith, the band of Charity, the band of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, the band of their ſeveral Vocations, by which they ſerve one another; and theſe are properly Religious bands, Church-bands, by means of which this Myſtical <hi>body is one,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.4.</note> and the Church one, as our Saviour ſaies, <hi>My dove, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled is but one.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 6.9 <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unam.</hi>
                     </note> And ſo is it taught in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed to believe <hi>one Church.</hi> Nor doth the multitude and variety of members hinder the unity of this body. In the Divine Eſſence there are three Perſons really diſtinct, yet but one God. In the Perſon of Chriſt there are two Natures, Humane and Divine, as different as Heaven and Earth, Infinite and Finite, and yet but one Chriſt. And, to come lower there are many Sun-beames, yet but one Sun, one Light: many branches and arms of a tree, yet but one tree: ſo in the Church there are many members, yet but one body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the multitude and variety of members: though the body be but one, yet it hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the body is not all eye, nor all ear, but there be eyes, ears, hands, feet, &amp;c. And theſe are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different, each from other; ſome are more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, others leſſe: ſome ſtronger, others weaker; ſome have more excellent abilities, and ſerve for more noble uſes then others: So is it in the Church: the body of the Church is but one, but the particular members of it are many, and they greatly different: ſome are ſet in higher place, neerer to Chriſt the head,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115897:190"/> others lower, at a greater diſtance, and more remote from him. Accordingly, ſome are furniſht with more excellent gifts, and laid out for more noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then others. As in a great Family there are divers members greatly different, ſome neerer to the Maſter of the Family, ſome more remote, there are Children nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then any Servant: and among the Servants, one is Steward, and another is a Scullion in the Kitchin. And in an Army, the Army is one, yet there are Multitudes and ſeveral Companies of Souldiers, and they diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Uſe and Honour one from another; there are Captaines, Lievtenants, Sergeants, and common Souldiers, ſome neerer in place to the General of the Army, and ſome more remote. So in the Church it is, according to the wiſe diſpoſition of God: hear Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.6</note> 
                     <hi>Having gifts different according to the grace that is given to us.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.7</note> 
                     <hi>Every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</hi> Yea, hear him largely diſputing of this ſubject.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.4 Verſ. 5. Verſ. 6 Verſ. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>There are diverſities of gifts, There are diverſities of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, There are diverſities of operations: To one is given the word of wiſedome, to another the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to another faith, &amp;c.</hi> All this concernes the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of gifts, which ariſes from, and is according to, the variety of members: of which he adds;<note place="margin">Verſ. 17.18</note> 
                     <hi>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? and if all were hearing, where were the ſmelling? But now God hath placed the members, every one of them, in the body, as it hath pleaſed him.</hi> And finally, (in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the compariſon) he ſpeakes more plainly. <hi>Now ye</hi> (ſaies he to the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth) are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 27.28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church; Firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. Are all Apoſtles? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reſemblance holds in the uſefulneſs of the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115897:191"/> members. There is not any the leaſt member of the natural body,<note place="margin">Natura nil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit fruſtra.</note> which hath not its uſe; its made for ſome purpoſe or other: <hi>Nature doth nothing in vain,</hi> much leſſe the God of Nature. To ſay nothing of the eyes and ears, the very feet are uſeful to the body, and ſo is any other member, that may be leaſt of all ſet by: hear we the Apoſtle confeſſing as much. <hi>The eye cannot ſay to the hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.22</note> 
                     <hi>I have no need of you; nor the head to the foot, I have no need of you: Nay much more thoſe members of the body that are more feeble, are neceſſary.</hi> In the Commonwealth the greateſt cannot miſs the meaneſt; there is not the Nobleſt Perſonage, to whom the meaneſt day-labourer, or Artificer is not uſeful. In the Army the Common Souldier is of uſe to the General: ſo in the Church, the meaneſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is of uſe to the Church, and to the moſt eminent members of it; he is uſeful, not as the eye or ear, yet at leaſt as the foot to the natural body: the pooreſt member of the Church hath received ſome abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or other, in ſome meaſure or other, by which in ſome way or other he may be uſeful, not by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not by Ruling, yet by his pious Examples, or fervent Prayers for the Church and the principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it: the poor Mouſe may be uſeful to the Lion, being bound with cords, by gnawing the cords aſunder and ſetting him at liberty: ſo may the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of leaſt account in the Church be beneficial to them of higheſt Note and Place, by his prayers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing at the hands of God his enlargement from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, into which he may be brought, as did thoſe Chriſtians aſſembled for Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act 12. Rom. 15.30.31. Eph 6 19 1 Theſſ. 5.25 2 Theſſ. 3.1, 2</note> or fitneſſe for and bleſſing and ſucceſs in his great and important affaires. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> acknowledging this doth frequently and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire the help of the Churches in their prayers to God for him.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:115897:191"/>4. The Reſemblance holds further in the point of ſympathizing. The Members of the natural Body ſympathize each with other, both in good and evil: Of this the Apoſtle ſays; <hi>Whether one member ſuffers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.26</note> 
                     <hi>all the members ſuffer with it; or whether one member be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi> If the Foot be foul, the Hand wipes it: if one treads on the Toe, not the Toe, but the Tongue cries out, Why do you tread on me? but, if any notorious wrong be offered to the Body, or any Member of it, ye ſhall have the Voyce lamenting, the Eye weeping, the Heart ſighing, the Hands pleading, the Head hanging down, and every part compaſſionate. No leſs is there a ſympathizing between the Members of the Body, in reſpect of any good betiding the whole Body, or any Member of it: Hath any ſick man obtained health? ye ſhall have every Member expreſſing joy in it's own way for the health of the Body ſo reſtored. No leſs is it ſo in the Church of God. The proſperity of the Church, or of any Member of it, affects every true and living Member of the Church, and puts joy into him, as if it were his own proſperity: The dejected and afflicted eſtate of the Church doth no leſs fill them with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and heavineſs. This we ſee required by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rejoyce with them that rejoyce,</hi>

               <p n="1">I. In reſpect of the firmneſs of the Church: Saint <hi>Chryſostom</hi> takes knowledg of this Particular.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <q>Deſervedly (ſays he) is the Church likened to an Hill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is firm and ſtable, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken to pieces. As an Hill cannot be caſt down, ſo neither the Church of God. No power of men, nor yet of Hell, can ſo far prevail.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18</note>
                  </q> It's the aſſurance of our Saviour: <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:115897:200"/>
               <p>Particular viſible Churches may be prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and ſo may fail; as we have ſeen by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of many famous Churches in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and other places: but the whole Church never failed.</p>
               <p>The glory and ſplendor of the Church may be much eclipſed, and the numbers of it much decreaſed, yet ſtill a Church hath been. When the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie prevailed moſt, in ſo much that the whole World la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that it was turned <hi>Arian;</hi> yet there were ſome Catholique Biſhops, and Catholique Chriſtians, that held the Faith of the Conſubſtantiality of the Son with the Father, and theſe were the Church. And in the Times of the Roman Apoſtaſy, when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed moſt in the World, even then were ſome, that did profeſs and maintain the Faith of Chriſt, and the purity of Gods Worſhip againſt the Hereſies and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſealed the Truth of God with their blood; and theſe were the Church then.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this ſtability of the Church are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Power of God, the Builder and Founder of the Church: for, what Men or Devils, being of finite power, can prevail to throw down the Building of this God, whoſe Power is infinite? for,<note place="margin">Job 9.4</note> 
                  <hi>who ever ſtrengthened himſelf againſt God, and proſpered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtrength of the Foundation upon which the Church is built, Chriſt a Rock:<note place="margin">Matth. 16.18</note> 
                  <hi>upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> ſays our Saviour; that is, upon Chriſt, the Rock, the ſubject of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Confeſſion, and thereupon he infers; therefore,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.24</note> 
                  <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it:</hi> for ſo the Houſe built on the Rock ſtood impregnably againſt all aſſaults of rain, and floods, and winds; and the reaſon is given,<note place="margin">Verſe 25</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe it was built on a Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:115897:201"/>
               <p>This affords great comfort to the Church againſt all her Enemies. Thou, O Church of God, haſt many Enemies, Satan, that Prince of Darkneſs, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-agents; Hereticks on the one ſide, and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks on the other ſide, and many wicked and profane men in the World:<note place="margin">Pſalm 137.7</note> and theſe are cruelly bent, and full of malice againſt thee, crying, <hi>Raze it, raze it, even to the Foundation thereof:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and 83.4</note> Their aim and endeavor is, <hi>That the Name of Iſrael may no more be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:</hi> and oft they are armed with great ſecular power: but yet fear not, God is with thee: he that built thee, will uphold thee; and, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid for the comfort of his Subjects againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 32.7, 8</note> 
                  <hi>There are more with thee, then with them: with them is an arm of fleſh, but with thee is the Lord thy God.</hi> And thou art built upon Chriſt the Foundation; therefore all oppoſition made againſt thee, to remove thee out of thy place, ſhall never prevail againſt thee.</p>
               <p>And let all Enemies, upon this ground, be adviſed to deſiſt from their cruel attempts againſt the Church: Who would undertake to waſh the Black-moor, or any other labor in vain? Such will your endeavors be in this kinde, as if a man ſhould undertake to remove an Hill out of its place: for ſo is the Church an Hill, firm and ſtable: it ſhall ſtand and remain, when ye have done the worſt that ye can do: yea, your endeavors are againſt God, who hath founded this Hill, the Church; and againſt Chriſt, the Rock, upon whom it is founded; and conſequently againſt your ſelves; and ye can expect no other iſſue of your attempts in this way, but ruine to your ſelves. Deſiſt therefore in time, if ye love your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In reſpect of propinquity and nearneſs to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: as the Hills, in regard of their height, are nearer to Heaven, then other lower parts of the Earth; ſo is
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115897:201"/> the Church, ſo are godly Chriſtians, the Members of the Church, nearer to God, then any other people under Heaven, and God nearer to them,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.13</note> then to any others: The Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> as they were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> before they were converted to the Faith of Chriſt, ſays, They <hi>were far off;</hi> but, ſpeaking of them after their Converſion, he ſays,<note place="margin">Verſe 19</note> They were <hi>made nigh.</hi> And, a little after, <hi>Ye are no longer</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Pſalm 145.18</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſays the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>is near to all them that call upon him in Truth:</hi> They have a free and ready acceſs to God by Prayer, with hope of audience. <hi>Through him</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) that is, through Chriſt, <hi>we both,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.18</note> Believers both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, have an acceſs to the Father.</hi> But, as for wicked men, they are far off, they have no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of acceſs to God by Prayer, no hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with God in Prayer; nay, to the wicked God ſays, <hi>Though ye make many prayers, I will not hear:</hi>

                  <hi>and when they offer burnt-ſacrifice and an oblation, I will not accept them.</hi> And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Church and the Members of it, all godly Chriſtians, are near to God, as having an open enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into Heaven, to enjoy God, and live with him in Glory and Happineſs for ever:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9 Matth. 20 James 1.12 Heb. 10.23</note> 
                  <hi>God hath prepared it for them; and it ſhall be given to them, for whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: God hath promiſed it to them, and faithful is He that hath promiſed:</hi> Yea, Chriſt hath purchaſed it for them, and therefore they cannot miſs of it: but, as for the wicked, God will know them afar off; there ſhall be no enterance for them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9</note> 
                  <hi>No unrighteous perſon</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And Saint <hi>John</hi> ſays of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>See the difference between the Church and the Members of it, and all wicked men that are ſtrangers from it: great is the preferment and Happineſs of the one; moſt ſad is the condition of the other: let wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men be humbled and caſt down, let the godly be comforted, and be thankful to God for this, That they are ſo preferred.</p>

Thou pulleſt up out of thy field the roots of Thornes,<note place="margin">De agro tuo extirpas radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ſpinarum, &amp; de corde non extirpas radicem mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cupiditatum? purgas agrum tuum, unde capiat fructum venter tuus, &amp; non purgas cor tuum, ubi habitet Deus tuus? <hi>De Temp. ſer. 205.</hi>
                     </note> and doeſt thou not pull up out of thy heart the roots of evil luſts?

               <p n="2">2. Let God rule and bear ſway in us: for he dwells in us, and we are his Houſe and Habitation: and we can readily confeſs, That it's agreeable to Reaſon, that every one ſhould have his pleaſure in his own Houſe: The Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.4.</note> giving Rules to Biſhops, gives them power to rule in their own Houſes. And <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> upon occaſion of <hi>Vaſhti's</hi> diſobedience,<note place="margin">Eſth. 1.22</note> made that Law, <hi>That every man ſhould bear rule in his own Houſe.</hi> Much leſs muſt this power be denied to God: but we are all of us Gods Houſe and Habitation, as we are Chriſtians, let us therefore be willing to be ordered and ruled by him, and all within us; let us be at his beck and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: Will he lift us up? or will he caſt us down? Will he continue Life and Health? or will he ſend Sickneſs firſt, and Death afterward? Let us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and be content, that God ſhould honor himſelf in and upon us in any of theſe ways. Eminent was the Example of <hi>David</hi> in this kinde: when, being ſain, becauſe of <hi>Abſalom's</hi> unnatural inſurrection, to fly from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Prieſts had brought out the Ark with him, he ſends it back with this pious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115897:207"/> 
                  <hi>If I ſhall finde favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back, and ſhew me both it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.25 26</note> 
                  <hi>and his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but if he thus ſay, I have no pleaſure in thee; behold, here I am, let h m do to me as ſeems good unto him.</hi> God hath abſolute power over us, as the Maſter of the Houſe hath to diſpoſe of the ſeveral rooms to what uſes he pleaſes, which to make his Hall, Parlor, and which his Kitchin, Buttery, &amp;c. And he is a God of infinite Wiſdom, beſt knowing which way it's beſt for his glory, and for our good, to diſpoſe of us. Says he, Go? let us go: Says he, Abide here? let us abide: Says he, <hi>Come to me, my Spouſe, out of Lebanon?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 4.8 and 1.4</note> let us, follow him readily, ſaying with the Church, <hi>Draw us, and we will run after thee.</hi> Finally, and eſpecially, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he this or that? or forbids he this or that? Harken to him, and yield him ready obedience: in all let us readily give our ſelves to be ordered by him, that it may be with us, as the Centurion teſtified of thoſe that were under him; <hi>I ſay to this man, Go, and he goes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 8.9</note> 
                  <hi>to this man, Come, and he comes; to my Servant, Do this, and he doth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Being built up an Habitation for God, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſelves wholy for his uſe, for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Can we entertain an Indweller more honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then he is? for he it is, <hi>by whom Kings reign,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8.16</note> 
                  <hi>and Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> He it is, that ſets up one, and pulls down another: He it is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.1, 2</note> 
                  <hi>that is clothed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as with a garment:</hi> He it is,<note place="margin">Iſai. 66.1</note> to whom <hi>Heaven is a Throne, and Earth a Footſtool.</hi> Can we entertain an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dweller more commodious and beneficial then he is? for what is it, in which he is not uſeful unto us? for, both for Soul and Body, <hi>he daily lades us with benefits.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm 68.20</note> But, were it poſſible, that an Indweller could be found that were more honorable, or more beneficial, yet Reaſon requires, That the Houſe ſhould be for the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115897:208"/> reception and entertainment of him that is the right Owner and Maſter of it, except he ſhall reſign his right, and appoint it for the entertainment of ſome other. Behold! we are built an Habitation for God, nor finde we that he hath reſigned up his right to any other. Let us therefore, as Equity requires it, keep our ſelves free from all others for the uſe of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The moſt men are quite contrary, in ſtead of God, harboring their ſeveral luſts; one Covetouſneſs, another Pride, another Voluptuouſneſs and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancy, another Malice and Envy, &amp;c. and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Satan in all theſe luſts: Fooliſh men in the higheſt degree! rejecting the glorious God for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Creature; the God that made us, and hath every way done us good, for our ſworn Enemy, that hath vowed, and every day ſeeks our ruine: for this is he,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8</note> 
                  <hi>who goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And, as for our luſts, in the harboring of which we harbor Satan, howſoever they may ſeem, ſome way or other, advantageous to us, yet <hi>they fight againſt our Souls,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.11</note> though ſecretly, yet in this reſpect ſo much the more dangerouſly. Beſides that, herein they are notoriouſly unjuſt againſt God himſelf, putting him out of his palace to receive Satan in his room; as it were, to put a man out of his own dwelling Houſe, and to put a ſtranger, or his Enemy, into the poſſeſſion of it. Let the guilty conſider it, and be humbled, and let us all carefully avoid it. Keeping our ſelves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the Lords uſe, and for his reception, let us not ſuffer any vile luſt willingly to neſtle in any corner of our Souls: It may haply ſeem hard to us ſo to do, as it did to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21</note> to caſt out the Bond-woman, and her Son; but we muſt do it, if we deſire that God ſhould take delight to dwell in us. God and the Devil will not dwell under the ſame roof: nor will he

                     </note> but receives her Light from the Sun: and ſo by the Moon we are to underſtand the Church, becauſe ſhe hath no Light of her own, but is illuſtrated and enlightened by Chriſt, who in ſcripture is called the Sun.</q> And ſo <hi>Sadeel,</hi> from Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

                  </note> makes the Compariſon between them: <q>As the Moon ſhines, not with her own, but anothers Light, becauſe, being lighted by the Sun-beams, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all her Light from thence: ſo the Church ſhines, not with her own Light, but as enlightened with the brightneſs of Chriſt, and with
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:115897:209"/> his ſingular gifts and benefits.</q> And thus alſo <hi>Weemſe</hi> makes the Compariſon:<note place="margin">Of the Cerem. Law, Exerc. 22</note> 
                  <q>As the Moon (ſays he) hath her Light from the Sun; ſo hath the Church her Light from Chriſt. The Sun gives Light, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives none; the Moon both gives Light, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let not then the Church, and the Members of it, be puft up with pride for the Light which they give to others, but carry themſelves in all humility and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of minde: Thou haſt Light, and thou giveſt Light, whether by word of Doctrine, or by example of Life; but be not proud: This Light thou haſt not in and of thy ſelf, but from Chriſt the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: why ſhould you behave your ſelf proudly? Thus doth the Apoſtle argue: <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7</note> 
                  <hi>and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou boaſt? &amp;c.</hi> Arrogate nothing to thy ſelf, but give all the glory to Chriſt, from whom thou receivedſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Moon, when ſhe ſhines brighteſt, hath her ſpots: ſo there is no Church ſo pure, but ſhe hath her blemiſhes, nor any Chriſtian ſo exactly perfect, but he hath his imperfections, under which he labors, and his ſins, by which he offends God. As for Churches, look we upon them that were planted by the Apoſtles, and we ſhall ſee, that they had their blemiſhes: The Church of <hi>Coriath</hi> was a famous Church of God, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by him in all utterance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.5, 7</note>

                  <hi>It's reported to me</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that there are contentions among you. This therefore I ſay, that every one of you ſays, I am of Paul, and I of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Verſe 21</note> And again in the ſame place: <hi>When ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eat, every one eats before other his own ſupper, and

                  <hi>So haſt thou them that hold the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</hi> So to the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> he ſays,<note place="margin">20</note> 
                  <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, that thou ſuffereſt the woman Jezabel.</hi> And to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi>

                  <hi>Thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt, and art dead.</hi> And how deeply did he charge the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> with lukewarmneſs, <hi>That they were neither hot nor cold.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 15</note> And if theſe Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches, and that in the Apoſtles times, had ſo ſoon contracted ſuch Sullies, who ſhall wonder, that all the following Churches have had, and have their blemiſhes?</p>
               <p>And no leſs holds it true in reſpect of particular godly Chriſtians, That as the Moon hath her ſpots, ſo they have their blemiſhes, even the beſt of meer men: That of <hi>Solomon</hi> holds univerſally true,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 6.36</note> 
                  <hi>There is no man which ſins not.</hi> Conſonant to this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Saint <hi>James, In many things we offend all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 3.2</note> in which he alſo includes himſelf. And Saint <hi>John</hi> is peremptory (including alſo himſelf) <hi>If we ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 1.8</note> 
                  <hi>we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelf, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> And again: <hi>If we ſay, we have no ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 10</note> 
                  <hi>we make him a lyar, and his Word is not in us.</hi> And who of all
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:115897:210"/> the Saints, who are moſt commended in Scripture, have not cauſe to ſubſcribe this Truth? God makes his boaſt of <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 1.8</note> 
                  <hi>That there was none like to him on the Earth;</hi> yea, he could in his Apology make his Appeal to God,<note place="margin">10.7</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I am not wicked;</hi> and yet we have his confeſſion,<note place="margin">7.20</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do to thee, O thou Preſerver of men? David</hi> was a man after Gods own Heart,<note place="margin">2 Sam 12.13 Pſalm 38.4 40.12</note> yet he confeſſes, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord;</hi> yea, <hi>My ſins are gone over my head;</hi> yea, <hi>They are more then the hairs of my head. Daniel</hi> was a man greatly beloved; and yet we have his Confeſſion, in the firſt perſon plural, including him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">Dan 9.5</note> 
                  <hi>We have ſinned, we have committed iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then, in this particular, the Reſemblance holds good between the Church and the Moon, That the Moon hath her ſpots, and the Church, and godly Chriſtians, the Members of the Church, have their blemiſhes, while they live on this Earth.</p>
               <p>Hence learn many things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then abſolute Perfection is not to be expected in the Church in this World, nor is any viſible Church to be abandoned, nor the Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of it to be forſaken by us, for ſome blemiſhes, for ſome diſorders, which, haply, we may ſee in it, ſo long as it enjoys the Ordinances of God, the tokens of his preſence: Whither ſhall we travel, to finde a Church ſo refined, that it ſhould have no droſs, ſo reformed, that nothing ſhould be out of order, ſo exactly accompliſh'd, that it ſhould have no blemiſh? Chriſt ſends not a Bill of Divorce to any Church for every thing amiſs, nor for every Error in Doctrine, except it be fundamental, and univerſally received, and held with obſtinacy; therefore neither let us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be thus with any Church, forſake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it. Let us be ſenſible of any thing amiſs,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:115897:210"/> and pray to God, and do our beſt endeavors in our way to have all things ſet in right order; but let us not unkindly depart from the Church, ſo long as we ſee our Saviour preſent with it. It's true, that there will be a time when the Church ſhall be <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle;</hi> but to expect it in the time of this life,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.27</note> and to quarrel at the Church, becauſe it is not ſo now, were folly in an high degree, and great uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The like is to be ſaid of particular Chriſtians: Expect not Angelical Perfection at their hands, living on the face of the Earth; nor, becauſe we ſee ſome blemiſhes in their lives, let us therefore caſt them off as wicked Reprobates; but ſo long as we can diſcern any thing in them, with reſpect to which we may in charity judg them to be God's, let us give them the right hand of fellowſhip, and own them as Brethren: and, if we ſee them to miſcarry in any kinde, diſown them not, as paſt hope of being reclaimed, but ſtudy <hi>to restore them with the ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1</note> 
                  <hi>conſidering our ſelves, leſt we alſo be tempted.</hi> Have they blemiſhes? ſo have the beſt of us: and would we not take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, to be for this cauſe diſcarded by others? then deal not ſo unkindly with others, as to diſcard them for this cauſe: for this is the golden Rule of Equity, propounded by our Saviour as the ſum of the Law and the Prophets,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do to you, do ye even the ſame to them:</hi> and ſo,<note place="margin">Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.</note> on the other ſide, <hi>Do not that to another, which thou wouldſt not that another ſhould do to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Wonder not at the fruits of Gods ſeverity exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed againſt the Church of God, and againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar godly Chriſtians, the Members of the Church: They have their blemiſhes, their ſpots, their ſins, by which they alſo offend God: and where ſin goes
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115897:211"/> before, who can wonder, if puniſhment and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows after? What is more juſt, then that it ſhould be ſo? Yea, the Love of God to, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Care for, the Church, and the Members of it, requires it:<note place="margin">Rev. 3.19</note> 
                  <hi>As many</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>as I love, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and chasten.</hi> And, <hi>When ye are judged</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>ye are chastened of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.32</note> 
                  <hi>that ye ſhould not be condemned with the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 In this reſpect how neceſſary is it, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>God</hi> ſhould direct reproofes to the Church, and to godly Chriſtians in the Church? have ye your ſpots? and would not ye be cleanſed? have ye your ſins? and would ye not be reproved? how unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable is this? yea how do ye in this act againſt your precious ſoules? for nothing is more conducing to your happineſs, then faithful and ſeaſonable reproof, by which we endeavour to keep ſin from ſeizing on you, and making a prey of your ſoules. Say not, think not, that we ſpeak againſt you, and ſeek to diſgrace you: Its nothing ſo, for while we reprove your ſins, we ſpeak for you againſt your ſins which act againſt you; nor ſeek we to diſgrace you to others, but to diſgrace your ſins to you, and to make you out of love with them, and to draw you off from them, which otherwiſe will ruine you: Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſuch miſpriſions, and as you would do in a journey, take it in good part, to be told, that you are out of the way: Take it as ye will, we muſt do it, a neceſſity is laid upon us: for <hi>God</hi> hath given the commandment,<note place="margin">Iſai. 58.1</note> 
                  <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſin:</hi> And now wo will be to us, if, for fear of your diſpleaſure, we do it not: <hi>fear not their faces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 1.17</note> ſaies <hi>God</hi> to the Prophet, <hi>leaſt I confound thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:115897:211"/>5. This may be of great force to take us off from the exceſſive love of this preſent life, and willingly to accept of the motion of death: for while we live here below, as the moon hath her ſpots, ſo we have our blemiſhes, lying under a neceſſity of ſining, in regard of that body of ſin which we bear about us: from this neceſſity of ſining death ſhall exempt us: for then holineſſe ſhall be made in us complete and perfect, and the body of ſin ſhall be altogether waſted out of us, then we ſhall ſin no more, nor ſorrow more: now we are like the moon,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.43.</note> having ſpots, but then we ſhall <hi>ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdome of our Father.</hi> And what wiſe man, that intends his own good, would content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to remain in a ſtate of imperfection, when he may be brought to a ſtate of abſolute perfection?

               <p n="1">I. If the Church be our mother, let us carry our ſelves to her, as children ought, and ingenuous chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will, carry themſelves to their mothers.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Let us be deeply affected with the miſeries and afflictions of the Church: though we our ſelves, for our own parts, enjoy never ſo great proſperity: what ingenuous childe laies it not ſadly to heart, to ſee his mother under great affliction? The <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Babylon wept in remembrance of Sion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us not grieve the Church our mother by an unkind departure from her and her communion for ſome things amiſs in her, or becauſe we ſee in the Church a mixture of good and bad: how unnatural a Son were he, that ſhould diſdain and abominate his mother, becauſe ſhe comes ſhort of her wonted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? how heinouſly (and that how juſtly) would any mother take it at the hand of any child, to be ſo uſed? yet thus hath the Church been dealt withal by many, that have ſometime been held, as her children: as by the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, ſo by many in later times:
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:115897:214"/> the more is the pity and the greater is their ſin: But let not us follow the example of ſuch, but own and acknowledge the Church our mother, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God to amend, what is amiſs, remain ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in the fellowſhip of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If the Church be the mother of us all, even of all believers, whether <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> high or low, rich or poor, then let all believers (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the difference may be in other reſpects) own themſelves mutually as brethren of the neereſt kind: not onely children of the ſame father, as all <hi>Jacobs</hi> twelve Sons were, but alſo of the ſame mother, as were <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin:</hi> And let this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on keep us off from all things, that are contrary to love; envy, malice, contention, &amp;c. and provoke us the more to do all offices of love each to other. Its obſervable, what difference <hi>Joſeph</hi> did put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Benjamin</hi> and his other brethren. They were all his brethren by his fathers ſide, therefore he entertained them all,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.34</note> and <hi>ſent to every one of them meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from before him:</hi> but <hi>Benjamin</hi> was his brother both by Father and Mother, therefore <hi>his meſs was five times ſo much as any of theirs.</hi> And at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45.22</note> 
                  <hi>he gave to each of them changes of rayment; but to Benjamin he gave three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pieces of ſilver, and five changes of rayment.</hi> We cannot put this difference between believers, as if ſome had onely the ſame father with us, namely, God, and others had alſo the ſame mother, the Church, for Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayes moſt truly: <q>He,<note place="margin">Qui non habet Eccleſiam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, non habet Deum Patrem. <hi>De unit.

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.38</note> Who wonders to ſee or hear of a ſhip ſetting to Sea, to be ſubject to ſtorms and tempeſts? and meeting with ſuch, that the beſt or the greateſt in it to be toſs'd up and down, and to be Sea-ſick? This is the caſe here; for the Church is a ſhip upon the Sea of the World, and the beſt in the Church is a Paſſenger in this ſhip.</p>
               <p>And, expecting afflictions, let us provide aforehand to be <hi>fore-armed</hi> againſt them,<note place="margin">Praemonitus, praemunitus.</note> as we are <hi>fore-warned</hi> of them. The Mariner, ſetting out to Sea, expecting ſtorms and Pirats, furniſhes himſelf aforehand with thoſe things that may be of uſe to him againſt the one and the other, judging it an high point of folly to have them then to ſeek, when he ſhould uſe them: What is more uſeful to us againſt Afflictions, then the Grace of Patience? <hi>Ye had need of Patience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.38 Luke 21.19</note> ſays the Apoſtle: And ſo our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>In Patience poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs your Souls.</hi> Let it be our wiſdom therefore to work our Hearts aforehand to a Reſolution to bear Afflictions patiently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reſemblance between a ſhip and the Church holds in the means of the ſafety of a ſhip, and ſo of the Church: as Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> hath it in theſe words; <q>God the Father ſits in the hinder part of this ſhip,<note place="margin">In puppe Pater reſidet guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator, proram Paracletus ſervat Spiritus. <hi>To. 1. lib. de Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone.</hi>
                     </note> as the Maſter and Governor of it, to guide its courſe; and the Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter, keeps the Fore-ſhip.</q> And moreover, for an Anchor (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary alſo to the ſafety of a ſhip) God hath given us that bleſſed Grace of Hope, even the Hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.19</note> 
                  <hi>which</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>we have as an Anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt;</hi> of ſpecial uſe to make us ſtedfaſt, to ſtand impregnable againſt, and in the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:115897:217"/> midſt of all the ſtorms of Perſecution raiſed up againſt us in the World.</p>
               <p>Oh what Comfort is this to us? What aſſurance ſhall it not give us of ſafety againſt all the oppoſition, which Satan and his Imps make againſt us and the Church. The ſafety of a ſhip depends much, under God, upon the care and vigilancy, the ſkill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Maſter: Behold! the Maſter and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this ſhip of the Church is God, and his bleſſed Spirit, or God by his Spirit: and who is comparable to him for any of theſe? Of his care and vigilancy hear what the Pſalmiſt ſays,<note place="margin">Pſalm 121</note> 
                  <hi>He that keeps Iſrael, ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep:</hi> As for his ſkill and wiſdom, the Apoſtle doubts not to call him <hi>the onely wiſe God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.17</note> and the Prophet ſays of him,<note place="margin">Jer. 32.19</note> That he is <hi>great in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and mighty in work:</hi> and how ſhall courage be wanting to him, to ſet himſelf, and to defend his ſhip the Church, againſt all that threaten the ruine of it? It's he (ſays the Pſalmiſt) <hi>which ſtills the noiſe of the Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm 65.7</note> 
                  <hi>the noiſe of their Waves, and the tumults of the People.</hi> And as for Satan, that Arch-Pirat, ſeeking to take or ſink this ſhip (though he be a Spirit, and therefore of great power againſt us, who are but fleſh and blood, yet) he is nothing to God, who is the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Spirit: That which is ſaid of the <hi>Behemoth,</hi> is no leſs true of him;<note place="margin">Job 40.18</note> 
                  <hi>He that made him, can make his Sword to approach unto him.</hi> Let therefore the power and malice of our Enemies be never ſo great, and their oppoſition againſt us never ſo fierce, yet we may comfortably reſt upon the aſſurance which our dear Saviour gives us,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.1</note> That <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church,</hi> much leſs any power on Earth.</p>
               <p>And ſee the great Mercy of God, That (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Church in this World is like to a ſhip on
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:115897:217"/> the Sea, and therefore ſubject to ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts) he hath given us that bleſſed Grace of Hope, the Hope of Salvation, whereby we may be kept ſteady, and not be hurried up and down, and driven upon Rocks and Sands, to our ruine and wrack: And it's not, as other Anchors, caſt down on the Earth, to take hold of that, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to God, <hi>It enters within the Vail,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.19</note> ſays the Apoſtle; it faſtens upon God and Chriſt, upon his Power, his Mercy, his Promiſe and Faithfulneſs; and therefore it's a ſtedfaſt Hope, and a ſure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, which cannot fail us, as not that God, on whom it faſtens: Oh be thankful for ſuch graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proviſion. Onely now let not this Grace of God be in vain towards us, but keep this Anchor charily,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.6</note> and <hi>hold faſt the confidence and rejoycing of this Hope unto the end.</hi> And if ye finde this Hope fading in you, endeavor to ſtrengthen it, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meditation of Gods Power and Mercy, and the Faithfulneſs of his Promiſes, and by the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his Dealings with his Church in former Times: and ſo ſhall ye finde it of ſingular uſe to uphold you againſt all the oppoſition, which Satan and the World ſhall make againſt you.</p>

                        </gap> integu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis, i. e. palcis in area fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta, &amp; vinaciis in torculari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vina exuuntur: Sicut in Eccleſia a multitudine ſeculari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um hominum, quae ſimul cum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis congregatur, quibus, ut naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerentur, neceſſaria erat illa mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo, id agitur, ut ſpiritali amore, per operationem miniſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Dei, ſeparentur.

                     </note> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Church: For, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Threſhing-floor, or in the Wine-preſs, the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to ſever the Fruit from the Coverings, which yet were neceſſary, that they might be, and that they might grow, and come to ripeneſs for Harveſt and Vintage: From theſe Covers they are ſevered, that is, the Grain from the Chaff in the Threſhing-floor, and the Wine from the ſkins and kernels of the Grapes in the Wine-preſs. So in the Church, this is the main buſineſs, That, from the multitude of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:115897:218"/> worldly men, which is mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the good (to whom yet, that they might be born, that multitude was neceſſary) the good might be ſevered, by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love, by the Labors of the Miniſters of God. But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That the good ſhould be ſeparated from the bad, not in place, but in affection, although (in regard of bodily preſence) they converſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Church: but there ſhall be another Time, in which the good Grain ſhall be ſet apart from the Chaff into the Garners, and the Wine from the Dregs into the Cellars.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And here are many Things to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the Church hath a mixture in it of good and bad, of Elect and Reprobate, as in the Threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-floor the Wheat and Chaff are together, and the Wine and Dregs in the Wine-preſs: the Church Militant in this World never was without ſuch mixture.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That this mixture of the good and bad is neceſſary and uſeful to the good, namely, ſays the Father, That the godly may be born, and brought into the World: for thus it oft pleaſes God, That from wicked Parents have ſprung godly Children, as from <hi>Korah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 16</note> the Ring-leader in that Faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> did iſſue Sons, that were (if not Penners of ſome of the Pſalms,<note place="margin">Pſalm 42. tit.</note> yet at leaſt) imployed in the ſinging of them: From wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ahaz</hi> a godly <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> from idolatrous <hi>Amon</hi> a tender-hearted <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and from <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:115897:219"/> made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, did iſſue a Son, <hi>in whom was found ſome good towards the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 14.13</note> 
                  <hi>who alone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of all the Houſe of Jeroboam, was buried, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further alſo this mixture of good and bad in the Church is expedient:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To let the godly ſee the Mercy of God to themſelves, doing them good by his ſacred Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, while the wicked live ſo unprofitably under them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To aggravate the ſins of the wicked, and to heighten their judgment, while (living under the ſame means of Grace, by which the godly are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to bring forth the fruits of Righteouſneſs to the Glory of God) they either uſe them not, or abuſe them, abounding in all wickedneſs to Gods diſhonor.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That living in the Church with the wicked, we muſt ſeparate our ſelves from them in affection and practiſe, not running with them to the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of riot, not delighting in ſin, as they do, but to be as contrary to them, as poſſibly we can, in our Converſation: according to the advice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.11</note> 
                  <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> They trade in wickedneſs,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15</note> it's for us to endeavor <hi>to be holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> And no leſs muſt we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them in our affection: They love ſin, we muſt hate it,<note place="margin">Pſalm 97.10 38.18</note> as <hi>David</hi> adviſes us; <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate the thing that is evil:</hi> They joy in their ſins, we muſt ſay, as <hi>David, I will be ſorry for my ſins:</hi> They delight in the ſins of others, we muſt be affected as <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">119.136</note> who could ſay of himſelf, <hi>My eyes guſh down with rivers of tears, becauſe men keep not thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:115897:219"/>
               <p>And, being thus contrary to them,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is no need that we ſhould make a local ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the wicked, nor forſake the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, becauſe we ſee ſome wicked men in it: the ſins of the wicked ſhall hurt themſelves, not us, ſeparating our ſelves from their ſins. So ſaies the Wiſeman,<note place="margin">Prov. 5.22</note> 
                  <hi>His own iniquities ſhall take the wicked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> not others, that eſtrange themſelves from them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Yet there ſhall come a time, when there ſhall be a full and perfect ſeparation between the good and the bad: the godly, <hi>the ſheep, ſet on Chriſts right hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.33</note> and the wicked, <hi>the Goats, on his left hand: Theſe,</hi> the wicked, <hi>ſhall go into everlasting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">verſ 46. Pſal. 1.5</note> There ſhall then be <hi>a congregation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men,</hi> and no wicked men among them: wait with patience till the time comes, in which God will bring it ſo to paſs, but expect not ſuch a bodily ſeparation here in the time of this life, leaſt our expectation be: fruſtrated. It is enough for us, that it ſhall once be: the husbandman waits for the harveſt; and let us wait till the end of this world, then ſhall the harveſt be, and let us not quarrel at the <hi>Church,</hi> nor, as male-contents, depart from the fellowſhip of the <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe this ſeparation is not made juſt when we would have it: Let it ſuffice us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taught us, that it ſhall not be until the harveſt in the end of the world, and therefore let us be ſo wiſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> as not to look for it ſooner. Let it be enough for us, that God, whoſe decrees are, as the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> unalterable, hath appointed this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to be made, and the Agents, by whom it is to be made, the Reapers, the Angels, and the time, when it ſhall be made, the Harveſt in the end of the world: and therefore let us not fail to expect it in the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:115897:220"/> ſeaſon of it; and let this expectation comfort us againſt the preſent mixture that is in the Church, and againſt the inconveniencies, which ſeem to attend it. <hi>Conſider,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have by the help of God, fulfilled the task, which I undertook of Parallels in three Books. In the firſt ye have ſeen the Parallels between the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and the foreſignifying Types of him, both Perſons and things. In the ſecond, ye have ſeen the agreement between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and thoſe other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances, by which he is ſet forth either in the old or new Teſtament. In the third, the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Church</hi> and the Types, by which it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignified, and other reſemblances, by which its ſet forth in Scriptures. The iſſue of all is, that we all learn to carry our ſelves in a due manner, to God, to our dear Saviour, to the <hi>Church,</hi> and to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the members of the <hi>Church,</hi> according to the particulars expreſt ſeverally in theſe three Books.</p>
               <p>And now to God alone, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, Three in One, and One in Three, be aſcribed all Honour and Glory, Dominion and Might, for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
